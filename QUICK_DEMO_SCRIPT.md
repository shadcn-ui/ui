**Click:** Team Performance tab

**Say:**
> "Sarah Wijaya is our top performer—1.28 billion in sales with a 5.8% conversion rate. That's 38% higher than the team average. Her manager can now understand what she's doing differently and coach the rest of the team."

**Key number to emphasize:** "15.8% revenue growth month-over-month"

**Transition:**

## 🎤 Response Scripts for Common Questions

### "How much does it cost?"

> "Great question. Pricing depends on the number of users, which modules you need, and whether you prefer cloud or on-premise. For a company your size, typically between [range] per month for cloud, or [range] one-time for on-premise. I can prepare a detailed quote after our discovery session when I understand your exact needs."

### "How long is implementation?"

> "8 to 12 weeks from kickoff to go-live for most companies. We do phased rollouts—start with critical modules like production and accounting in weeks 1-6, then add others. You're up and running while we're still implementing advanced features."

### "Can you customize it?"

> "Absolutely. Everything you saw—workflows, fields, reports—is configurable. We start with industry best practices and then customize to your processes. About 80% is configuration, 20% might need custom development depending on your unique needs."

### "What if we need training?"

> "Comprehensive training is included. We train super-users in each department over 2 weeks. They become your internal experts. We provide video tutorials, user manuals, and 90 days of intensive support post go-live."

### "Cloud or on-premise?"

> "Both available. Most clients prefer cloud for automatic updates, access from anywhere, and lower IT overhead. But if you have security requirements or want full control, we can deploy on your servers. There's also a hybrid option."

### "What about our existing data?"

> "We handle data migration as part of implementation. Our team will map your current data—whether it's in spreadsheets, old systems, or databases—and migrate it cleanly. We do parallel runs to ensure accuracy before you fully switch over."

### "Can it integrate with [other system]?"

> "Yes, we have APIs for integration. We've connected with [mention relevant systems: e-commerce platforms, payment gateways, shipping providers]. If it has an API or exports data, we can integrate it. Custom integrations are part of our implementation service."

### "We're not ready to decide today"

> "I completely understand—this is a significant decision. How about we schedule a light discovery session—no commitment—so when you are ready, we've already mapped your needs? That way implementation can start faster when you give the green light."
