Upgrade the MCP server to MCP TypeScript SDK v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/server`). `shadcn mcp` now serves MCP protocol 2026-07-28 as well as earlier versions. The `shadcn/mcp` export is now an `McpServer`, and a new `createServer()` export returns a fresh instance per connection. Code that called `server.setRequestHandler(...)` on the old `Server` export should use `server.registerTool(...)` or `server.server.setRequestHandler(...)` instead.
