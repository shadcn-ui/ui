# LaunchKit — Sales & Execution Plan

---

## PHASE 1: PRODUCT DEFINITION

### Product Name
**LaunchKit — SaaS Dashboard Starter**

### Problem It Solves
Every SaaS founder spends 2-4 weeks building the same dashboard UI before they can ship their actual product. Login pages, settings panels, billing screens, sidebar navigation — it's all boilerplate that looks the same across every app. LaunchKit eliminates that setup time entirely.

### Who Buys It
- Indie hackers launching a SaaS product
- Freelancers building client dashboards
- Agencies that need a starting point for client projects
- Developers who want a polished foundation instead of starting from scratch

### Why They Buy Instead of Building
- Saves 40+ hours of UI work
- Built with the exact stack they'd choose anyway (Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind)
- Professionally designed — not amateur-hour
- Dark mode, responsive, accessible out of the box
- Every SaaS needs the same 5 pages — this has all of them

### One-Sentence Value Proposition
**Ship your SaaS dashboard in hours, not weeks — with a professional Next.js starter built on shadcn/ui.**

### 5 Bullet Benefits
1. **5 production-ready pages** — Dashboard, Login, Signup, Settings, Billing, plus empty state patterns
2. **Built on shadcn/ui** — The most popular React component library. Fully customizable, no vendor lock-in
3. **Dark mode + responsive** — Works on every device, in every theme, out of the box
4. **Clean architecture** — App Router, TypeScript, proper folder structure. No cleanup needed
5. **Add your backend** — Works with any auth (Clerk, NextAuth), any database (Prisma, Drizzle), any payment provider (Stripe)

## PHASE 5: SALES COPY (Gumroad Product Description)

### Headline
**LaunchKit — SaaS Dashboard Starter**

### Subheadline
Stop building the same dashboard from scratch. Ship your SaaS product in hours with a professional Next.js starter.

### Body

Every SaaS app needs the same five pages: login, dashboard, settings, billing, and an empty state. You already know this. You've built them before. Multiple times.

LaunchKit gives you all five — professionally designed, fully responsive, dark mode included — built with Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn/ui.

No subscriptions. No lock-in. Just clean code you own forever.

**What's included:**

- Login and Signup pages with email + Google OAuth layout
- Dashboard with KPI cards, transactions table, and recent sales
- Settings page with tabs: Profile, Team Management, Notifications
- Billing page with plan comparison, usage meters, and invoice history
- Customers page with a polished empty state
- Collapsible sidebar navigation with keyboard shortcut
- Dark/light mode with system detection
- Fully responsive — mobile, tablet, desktop
- TypeScript throughout
- Clean project structure ready for your backend

**Built with:**

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components
- Radix UI for accessibility

**What's NOT included (intentionally):**

- No auth logic — use Clerk, NextAuth, Supabase, whatever you prefer
- No database — use Prisma, Drizzle, your choice
- No payments — integrate Stripe, Lemon Squeezy, etc.
- No deployment config — deploy to Vercel, Railway, anywhere

This is a frontend starter. You bring the backend. That's the point.

### Who This Is For

- You're building a SaaS and don't want to spend weeks on UI
- You're a freelancer who needs a professional starting point for client work
- You know Next.js and shadcn/ui and want to skip the boilerplate
- You value your time at more than $49

### Who This Is NOT For

- You want a complete SaaS with auth, database, and payments included
- You're looking for a no-code solution
- You need a landing page (this is a dashboard)
- You want someone else to build your product for you
