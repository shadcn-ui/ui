title: Introduction
description: Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.
---

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._

## FAQ

		Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._

Why don't I get tailwind auto completion in vscode / WebStorm when using `cn()`?
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

Intellisense needs to know what to look for, and does not natively know about cn() as it is a local utility function that combines [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) and [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge).

Add the following to your editor settings:

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["(cn\\(([^)]*)\\)", "(?:'|\"|`)([^']*)(?:'|\"|`)"]
  ]
}
```

Other examples may be found via the [tailwind-intellisense-regex-list](https://github.com/paolotiu/tailwind-intellisense-regex-list).
