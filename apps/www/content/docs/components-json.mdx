title: components.json
description: Configuration for your project.
---

The `components.json` file holds configuration for your project.

We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

<Callout className="mt-6">
  Note: The `components.json` file is optional and **only required if you're
  using the CLI** to add components to your project. If you're using the copy
  and paste method, you don't need this file.
</Callout>

You can create a `components.json` file in your project by running the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

See the <Link href="/docs/cli">CLI section</Link> for more information.

## $schema

You can see the JSON Schema for `components.json` [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json).

```json title="components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json"
}
```

## style

We are introducing a new concept called _Style_.

_You can think of style as the visual foundation: shapes, icons, animations & typography._ A style comes with its own set of components, animations, icons and more.

We are shipping two styles: `default` and `new-york` (with more coming soon).

<Image
  src="/images/style.jpg"
  width="716"
  height="402"
  alt="Default vs New York style"
  className="border rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6"
/>

The `default` style is the one you are used to. It's the one we've been using since the beginning of this project. It uses `lucide-react` for icons and `tailwindcss-animate` for animations.

The `new-york` style is a new style. It ships with smaller buttons, cards with shadows and a new set of icons from [Radix Icons](https://icons.radix-ui.com).

When you run the `init` command, you will be asked which style you would like to use. This is saved in your `components.json` file.


**Important:** The selected style cannot be changed after initialization. 

```json title="components.json"
{
  "style": "new-york"
}
```

The `default` style has been deprecated. Use the `new-york` style instead.

## tailwind

Configuration to help the CLI understand how Tailwind CSS is set up in your project.

See the <Link href="/docs/installation">installation section</Link> for how to set up Tailwind CSS.

### tailwind.config

Path to where your `tailwind.config.js` file is located. **For Tailwind CSS v4, leave this blank.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js" | "tailwind.config.ts"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.css

Path to the CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS into your project.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "css": "styles/global.css"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.baseColor

This is used to generate the default color palette for your components. **This cannot be changed after initialization.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "baseColor": "gray" | "neutral" | "slate" | "stone" | "zinc"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.cssVariables

You can choose between using CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes for theming.

To use utility classes for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `false`. For CSS variables, set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `true`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "cssVariables": `true` | `false`
  }
}
```

For more information, see the <Link href="/docs/theming">theming docs</Link>.

**This cannot be changed after initialization.** To switch between CSS variables and utility classes, you'll have to delete and re-install your components.

### tailwind.prefix

The prefix to use for your Tailwind CSS utility classes. Components will be added with this prefix.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "prefix": "tw-"
  }
}
```

## rsc

Whether or not to enable support for React Server Components.

The CLI automatically adds a `use client` directive to client components when set to `true`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "rsc": `true` | `false`
}
```

## tsx

Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript components.

Setting this option to `false` allows components to be added as JavaScript with the `.jsx` file extension.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tsx": `true` | `false`
}
```

## aliases

The CLI uses these values and the `paths` config from your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file to place generated components in the correct location.

Path aliases have to be set up in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Important:** If you're using the `src` directory, make sure it is included
  under `paths` in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.
</Callout>

### aliases.utils

Import alias for your utility functions.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "utils": "@/lib/utils"
  }
}
```

### aliases.components

Import alias for your components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components"
  }
}
```

### aliases.ui

Import alias for `ui` components.

The CLI will use the `aliases.ui` value to determine where to place your `ui` components. Use this config if you want to customize the installation directory for your `ui` components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "ui": "@/app/ui"
  }
}
```

### aliases.lib

Import alias for `lib` functions such as `format-date` or `generate-id`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "lib": "@/lib"
  }
}
```

### aliases.hooks

Import alias for `hooks` such as `use-media-query` or `use-toast`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  }
}
```
