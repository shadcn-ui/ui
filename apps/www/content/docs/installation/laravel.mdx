  **Update:** We have added full support for React 19 and Tailwind v4 in the
  `canary` release. See the docs for [Tailwind v4](/docs/tailwind-v4) for more
  information.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Laravel project with Inertia and React using the laravel installer `laravel new my-app`:

```bash
laravel new my-app --typescript --breeze --stack=react --git --no-interaction
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use?
Which color would you like to use as base color?
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? â€º yes
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "@/Components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Steps>
