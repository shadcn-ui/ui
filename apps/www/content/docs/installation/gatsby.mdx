  **Update:** We have added full support for React 19 and Tailwind v3 in the
  `canary` release. See the docs for [Tailwind v4](/docs/tailwind-v4) for more
  information.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Gatsby project using `create-gatsby`:

```bash
npm init gatsby
```

### Configure your Gatsby project to use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

You will be asked a few questions to configure your project:

```txt showLineNumbers
✔ What would you like to call your site?
· your-app-name
✔ What would you like to name the folder where your site will be created?
· your-app-name
✔ Will you be using JavaScript or TypeScript?
· TypeScript
✔ Will you be using a CMS?
· Choose whatever you want
✔ Would you like to install a styling system?
· Tailwind CSS
✔ Would you like to install additional features with other plugins?
· Choose whatever you want
✔ Shall we do this? (Y/n) · Yes
```

### Edit tsconfig.json file

Add the following code to the `tsconfig.json` file to resolve paths:

```ts {4-9} showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Create gatsby-node.ts file

Create a `gatsby-node.ts` file at the root of your project if it doesn’t already exist, and add the code below to the `gatsby-node` file so your app can resolve paths:

```ts
import * as path from "path"

export const onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        "@/components": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/components"),
        "@/lib/utils": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/lib/utils"),
      },
    },
  })
}
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn-ui` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? no / yes
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › › ./src/styles/globals.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › @/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › @/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Steps>
