description: Install and configure Rsbuild.
---

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new React project using `rsbuild`:

```bash
npm create rsbuild@latest
```

### Add Tailwind and its configuration

Install `tailwindcss`, then generate your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss

npx tailwindcss init -p
```

<Callout>

Rsbuild has built-in [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), so you only need to register the tailwindcss plugin.

</Callout>

### Edit tsconfig.json file

Add the following code to the `tsconfig.json` file to resolve paths:

```ts {4-9} showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Update rsbuild.config.ts

Add the following code to the rsbuild.config.ts so your app can resolve paths without error

```bash
# (so you can import "path" without error)
npm i -D @types/node
```

```typescript
import path from "path"
import { defineConfig } from "@rsbuild/core"
import { pluginReact } from "@rsbuild/plugin-react"

export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
  plugins: [pluginReact()],
})
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn-ui` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? no / yes
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › › src/index.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › @/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › @/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no / yes (no)
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Steps>
