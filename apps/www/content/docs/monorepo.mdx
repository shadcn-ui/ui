Until now, using shadcn/ui in a monorepo was a bit of a pain. You could add
components using the CLI, but you had to manage where the components
were installed and manually fix import paths.

With the new monorepo support in the CLI, we've made it a lot easier to use
shadcn/ui in a monorepo.

The CLI now understands the monorepo structure and will install the components,
dependencies and registry dependencies to the correct paths and handle imports
for you.

## Getting started

<Steps>

### Create a new monorepo project

To create a new monorepo project, run the `init` command. You will be prompted
to select the type of project you are creating.

```bash
npx shadcn@canary init
```

Select the `Next.js (Monorepo)` option.

```bash
? Would you like to start a new project?
    Next.js
❯   Next.js (Monorepo)
```

This will create a new monorepo project with two workspaces: `web` and `ui`,
and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) as the build system.

Everything is set up for you, so you can start adding components to your project.

### Add components to your project

To add components to your project, run the `add` command **in the path of your app**.

```bash
cd apps/web
```

```bash
npx shadcn@canary add [COMPONENT]
```

The CLI will figure out what type of component you are adding and install the
correct files to the correct path.

For example, if you run `npx shadcn@canary add button`, the CLI will install the button component under `packages/ui` and update the import path for components in `apps/web`.

If you run `npx shadcn@canary add login-01`, the CLI will install the `button`, `label`, `input` and `card` components under `packages/ui` and the `login-form` component under `apps/web/components`.

### Importing components

You can import components from the `@workspace/ui` package as follows:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/button"
```

You can also import hooks and utilities from the `@workspace/ui` package.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "@workspace/ui/hooks/use-theme"
import { cn } from "@workspace/ui/lib/utils"
```

</Steps>

## File Structure

When you create a new monorepo project, the CLI will create the following file structure:

```txt
apps
└── web         # Your app goes here.
    ├── app
    │   └── page.tsx
    ├── components
    │   └── login-form.tsx
    ├── components.json
    └── package.json
packages
└── ui          # Your components and dependencies are installed here.
    ├── src
    │   ├── components
    │   │   └── button.tsx
    │   ├── hooks
    │   ├── lib
    │   │   └── utils.ts
    │   └── styles
    │       └── globals.css
    ├── components.json
    └── package.json
package.json
turbo.json
```

## Requirements

1. Every workspace must have a `components.json` file. A `package.json` file tells npm how to install the dependencies. A `components.json` file tells the CLI how and where to install components.

2. The `components.json` file must properly define aliases for the workspace. This tells the CLI how to import components, hooks, utilities, etc.

```json title="apps/web/components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "../../packages/ui/tailwind.config.ts",
    "css": "../../packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "zinc",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide",
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "hooks": "@/hooks",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "utils": "@workspace/ui/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@workspace/ui/components"
  }
}
```

```json title="packages/ui/components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
    "css": "src/styles/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "zinc",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide",
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@workspace/ui/components",
    "utils": "@workspace/ui/lib/utils",
    "hooks": "@workspace/ui/hooks",
    "lib": "@workspace/ui/lib",
    "ui": "@workspace/ui/components"
  }
}
```

3. Ensure you have the same `style`, `iconLibrary` and `baseColor` in both `components.json` files.

By following these requirements, the CLI will be able to install ui components, blocks, libs and hooks to the correct paths and handle imports for you.
