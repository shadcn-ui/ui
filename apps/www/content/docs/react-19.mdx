  **Update:** We have added full support for React 19 and Tailwind v4 in the
  `canary` release. See the docs for [Tailwind v4](/docs/tailwind-v4) for more
  information.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  **The following guide applies to any framework that supports React 19**. I
  titled this page "Next.js 15 + React 19" to help people upgrading to Next.js
  15 find it. We are working with package maintainers to help upgrade to React
  19.
</Callout>

## TL;DR

If you're using `npm`, you can install shadcn/ui dependencies with a flag. The `shadcn` CLI will prompt you to select a flag when you run it. No flags required for pnpm, bun, or yarn.

See [Upgrade Status](#upgrade-status) for the status of React 19 support for each package.

## What's happening?

React 19 is now [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react?activeTab=versions) and is [tested and supported in the latest Next.js 15 release](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15#react-19).

To support React 19, package maintainers will need to test and update their packages to include React 19 as a peer dependency. This is [already](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/pull/2952) [in](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk/pull/318) [progress](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul/pull/498).

```diff /^19.0/
"peerDependencies": {
-  "react": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0",
+  "react": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0 || ^19.0",
-  "react-dom": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0"
+  "react-dom": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0 || ^19.0"
},
```

<Callout>
  You can check if a package lists React 19 as a peer dependency by running
  `npm info <package> peerDependencies`.
</Callout>

In the meantime, if you are installing a package that **does not** list React 19 as a peer dependency, you will see an error message like this:

```bash
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error
npm error While resolving: my-app@0.1.0
npm error Found: react@19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021
npm error node_modules/react
npm error   react@"19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021" from the root project
```

<Callout>
  **Note:** This is npm only. PNPM and Bun will only show a silent warning.
</Callout>

## How to fix this

### Solution 1: `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`

You can force install a package with the `--force` or the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.

```bash
npm i <package> --force

npm i <package> --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will install the package and ignore the peer dependency warnings.

  <AccordionItem value="flags">
    <AccordionTrigger className="font-medium">
      What do the `--force` and `--legacy-peer-deps` flag do?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="[&_ul]:mt-0">

      - `--force`: Ignores and overrides any dependency conflicts, forcing the
        installation of packages.
      - `--legacy-peer-deps`: Skips strict peer dependency checks, allowing
        installation of packages with unmet peer dependencies to avoid errors.

    </AccordionContent>

  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Solution 2: Use React 18

You can downgrade `react` and `react-dom` to version 18, which is compatible with the package you are installing and upgrade when the dependency is updated.

```bash
npm i react@18 react-dom@18
```

Whichever solution you choose, make sure you test your app thoroughly to ensure
there are no regressions.

## Using shadcn/ui on Next.js 15

### Using pnpm, bun, or yarn

Follow the instructions in the [installation guide](/docs/installation/next) to install shadcn/ui. No flags are needed.

### Using npm

When you run `npx shadcn@latest init -d`, you will be prompted to select an option to resolve the peer dependency issues.

```bash
It looks like you are using React 19.
Some packages may fail to install due to peer dependency issues (see https://ui.shadcn.com/react-19).

? How would you like to proceed? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Use --force
    Use --legacy-peer-deps
```

You can then run the command with the flag you choose.

## Adding components

The process for adding components is the same as above. Select a flag to resolve the peer dependency issues.

**Remember to always test your app after installing new dependencies.**

## Upgrade Status

To make it easy for you track the progress of the upgrade, I've created a table below with React 19 support status for the shadcn/ui dependencies.

- ✅ - Works with React 19 using npm, pnpm, and bun.
- 🚧 - Works with React 19 using pnpm and bun. Requires flag for npm. PR is in progress.

## Recharts

To use recharts with React 19, you will need to override the `react-is` dependency.

<Steps>

<Step>Add the following to your `package.json`</Step>

```json title="package.json"
"overrides": {
  "react-is": "^19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021"
}
```

Note: the `react-is` version needs to match the version of React 19 you are using. The above is an example.

<Step>Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`</Step>

</Steps>
