One day, his advisors came to him\r\n        with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"mt-10 scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors first:mt-0\">\r\n        The King's Plan\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <p className=\"leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6\">\r\n        The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{\" \"}\r\n        <a\r\n          href=\"#\"\r\n          className=\"font-medium text-primary underline underline-offset-4\"\r\n        >\r\n          a brilliant plan\r\n        </a>\r\n        : he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <blockquote className=\"mt-6 border-l-2 pl-6 italic\">\r\n        \"After all,\" he said, \"everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair\r\n        that they should pay for the privilege.\"\r\n      </blockquote>\r\n      <h3 className=\"mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight\">\r\n        The Joke Tax\r\n      </h3>\r\n      <p className=\"leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6\">\r\n        The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but\r\n        the king was firm:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul className=\"my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2\">\r\n        <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>\r\n        <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>\r\n        <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p className=\"leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6\">\r\n        As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a\r\n        gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the king's\r\n        foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3 className=\"mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight\">\r\n        Jokester's Revolt\r\n      </h3>\r\n      <p className=\"leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6\">\r\n        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and\r\n        leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup,\r\n        even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to\r\n        stop Jokester.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6\">\r\n        And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes\r\n        left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh.
