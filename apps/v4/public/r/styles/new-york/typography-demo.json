One day, his advisors came to him\n        with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"mt-10 scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors first:mt-0\">\n        The King's Plan\n      </h2>\n      <p className=\"leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6\">\n        The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"#\"\n          className=\"font-medium text-primary underline underline-offset-4\"\n        >\n          a brilliant plan\n        </a>\n        : he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.\n      </p>\n      <blockquote className=\"mt-6 border-l-2 pl-6 italic\">\n        \"After all,\" he said, \"everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair\n        that they should pay for the privilege.\"\n      </blockquote>\n      <h3 className=\"mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight\">\n        The Joke Tax\n      </h3>\n      <p className=\"leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6\">\n        The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but\n        the king was firm:\n      </p>\n      <ul className=\"my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2\">\n        <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>\n        <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>\n        <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p className=\"leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6\">\n        As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a\n        gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the king's\n        foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.\n      </p>\n      <h3 className=\"mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight\">\n        Jokester's Revolt\n      </h3>\n      <p className=\"leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6\">\n        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and\n        leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup,\n        even in the royal toilet.
