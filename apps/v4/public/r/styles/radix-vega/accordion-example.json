This includes secure\n          password hashing and storage, multi-factor authentication (MFA)\n          implementation, session management, OAuth2 and SSO integration,\n          regular security audits, rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks,\n          and maintaining detailed audit logs.

This often involves using techniques like\n          CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types), vector clocks, and gossip\n          protocols. Systems might implement event sourcing patterns, utilize\n          message queues for asynchronous updates, and employ sophisticated\n          conflict resolution strategies. Popular solutions like Amazon&apos;s\n          DynamoDB and Google&apos;s Spanner demonstrate different approaches to\n          solving these challenges, balancing between consistency, availability,\n          and partition tolerance as described in the CAP theorem.\n        </AccordionContent>\n      </AccordionItem>\n    </Accordion>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction AccordionExample3() {\n  return (\n    <Accordion type=\"single\" collapsible className=\"gap-4\">\n      <AccordionItem value=\"billing\" className=\"rounded-lg border\">\n        <AccordionTrigger className=\"px-4 text-base font-medium\">\n          How does billing work?\n        </AccordionTrigger>\n        <AccordionContent className=\"text-muted-foreground px-4\">\n          We offer monthly and annual subscription plans.
