This includes secure\n          password hashing and storage, multi-factor authentication (MFA)\n          implementation, session management, OAuth2 and SSO integration,\n          regular security audits, rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks,\n          and maintaining detailed audit logs. Additionally, you&apos;ll need to\n          consider scalability, performance impact, and compliance with relevant\n          data protection regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA.\n        </AccordionContent>\n      </AccordionItem>\n      <AccordionItem value=\"item-2\">\n        <AccordionTrigger>\n          How does modern distributed system architecture handle eventual\n          consistency and data synchronization across multiple regions?\n        </AccordionTrigger>\n        <AccordionContent>\n          Modern distributed systems employ various strategies to maintain data\n          consistency across regions. This often involves using techniques like\n          CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types), vector clocks, and gossip\n          protocols. Systems might implement event sourcing patterns, utilize\n          message queues for asynchronous updates, and employ sophisticated\n          conflict resolution strategies. Popular solutions like Amazon&apos;s\n          DynamoDB and Google&apos;s Spanner demonstrate different approaches to\n          solving these challenges, balancing between consistency, availability,\n          and partition tolerance as described in the CAP theorem.\n        </AccordionContent>\n      </AccordionItem>\n    </Accordion>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction AccordionExample3() {\n  return (\n    <Accordion type=\"single\" collapsible className=\"flex flex-col gap-4\">\n      <AccordionItem value=\"billing\" className=\"rounded-lg border last:border\">\n        <AccordionTrigger className=\"px-4 text-base font-medium\">\n          How does billing work?\n        </AccordionTrigger>\n        <AccordionContent className=\"text-muted-foreground px-4\">\n          We offer monthly and annual subscription plans. Billing is charged at\n          the beginning of each cycle, and you can cancel anytime. All plans\n          include automatic backups, 24/7 support, and unlimited team members.\n          There are no hidden fees or setup costs.\n        </AccordionContent>\n      </AccordionItem>\n      <AccordionItem value=\"security\" className=\"rounded-lg border\">\n        <AccordionTrigger className=\"px-4 text-base font-medium\">\n          Is my data secure?\n        </AccordionTrigger>\n        <AccordionContent className=\"text-muted-foreground px-4\">\n          Yes. We use end-to-end encryption, SOC 2 Type II compliance, and\n          regular third-party security audits. All data is encrypted at rest and\n          in transit using industry-standard protocols. We also offer optional\n          two-factor authentication and single sign-on for enterprise customers.\n        </AccordionContent>\n      </AccordionItem>\n      <AccordionItem value=\"integration\" className=\"rounded-lg border!\">\n        <AccordionTrigger className=\"px-4 text-base font-medium\">\n          What integrations do you support?\n        </AccordionTrigger>\n        <AccordionContent className=\"text-muted-foreground px-4\">\n          We integrate with 500+ popular tools including Slack, Zapier,\n          Salesforce, HubSpot, and more.
