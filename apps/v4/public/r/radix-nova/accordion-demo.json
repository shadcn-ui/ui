This includes secure\n            password hashing and storage, multi-factor authentication (MFA)\n            implementation, session management, OAuth2 and SSO integration,\n            regular security audits, rate limiting to prevent brute force\n            attacks, and maintaining detailed audit logs. Additionally,\n            you&apos;ll need to consider scalability, performance impact, and\n            compliance with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR or\n            HIPAA.\n          </AccordionContent>\n        </AccordionItem>\n        <AccordionItem value=\"item-2\">\n          <AccordionTrigger>\n            How does modern distributed system architecture handle eventual\n            consistency and data synchronization across multiple regions?\n          </AccordionTrigger>\n          <AccordionContent>\n            Modern distributed systems employ various strategies to maintain\n            data consistency across regions. This often involves using\n            techniques like CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types), vector\n            clocks, and gossip protocols. Systems might implement event sourcing\n            patterns, utilize message queues for asynchronous updates, and\n            employ sophisticated conflict resolution strategies. Popular\n            solutions like Amazon&apos;s DynamoDB and Google&apos;s Spanner\n            demonstrate different approaches to solving these challenges,\n            balancing between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance\n            as described in the CAP theorem.\n          </AccordionContent>\n        </AccordionItem>\n      </Accordion>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n",
