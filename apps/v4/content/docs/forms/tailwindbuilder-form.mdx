## TailwindBuilder AI Form Builder

TailwindBuilder AI Form Builder allows you to **generate fully functional, production-ready forms in seconds** using natural language prompts.

Instead of manually wiring inputs, validation logic, error handling, and accessibility, TailwindBuilder instantly generates clean React code powered by:

- **shadcn/ui** for accessible, modern UI components
- **React Hook Form** for performant form state management
- **Zod** for type-safe schema validation
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling

You describe the form. TailwindBuilder builds it.

  **Why TailwindBuilder?**  
  Building forms is repetitive and time-consuming. TailwindBuilder removes boilerplate and gives you clean, editable code that follows best practices by default.
</Callout>

## What You Can Build

Using TailwindBuilder AI Form Builder, you can generate:

- Login, signup, and contact forms
- Multi-field and multi-step forms
- Forms with real-time validation and error messages
- Dynamic array fields (emails, tasks, items)
- Advanced inputs like selects, checkboxes, radios, and switches

All generated forms are **ready to use**, customizable, and framework-aligned.

---

## How It Works

1. **Write a prompt** describing your form  
   Example:  
   _“Create a bug report form with title and description, validate inputs, and show errors.”_

2. **TailwindBuilder generates the form**
   - React component using shadcn/ui
   - React Hook Form setup
   - Zod validation schema
   - Accessible markup

3. **Copy, customize, and ship**

No setup. No boilerplate. No guesswork.

## Generated Form Architecture

Every form generated by TailwindBuilder follows a scalable, production-ready architecture:

- **React Hook Form** for form state and submission
- **Zod schemas** for validation and error messages
- **shadcn/ui components** for consistent styling and accessibility
- **Tailwind CSS** utility classes for layout and spacing

This ensures your forms are:

- Accessible by default
- Easy to maintain
- Type-safe
- Performant

## Schema Validation with Zod

TailwindBuilder automatically generates a Zod schema based on your prompt.

```ts
import * as z from "zod"

export const formSchema = z.object({
  title: z
    .string()
    .min(5, "Title must be at least 5 characters"),
  description: z
    .string()
    .min(20, "Description must be at least 20 characters"),
})
