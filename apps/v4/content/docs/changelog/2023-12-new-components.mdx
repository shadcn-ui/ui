We've added new components to shadcn/ui and made a lot of improvements to the CLI.

Here's a quick overview of what's new:

- [**Carousel**](#carousel) - A carousel component with motion, swipe gestures and keyboard support.
- [**Drawer**](#drawer) - A drawer component that looks amazing on mobile.
- [**Pagination**](#pagination) - A pagination component with page navigation, previous and next buttons.
- [**Resizable**](#resizable) - A resizable component for building resizable panel groups and layouts.
- [**Sonner**](#sonner) - The last toast component you'll ever need.
- [**CLI updates**](#cli-updates) - Support for custom **Tailwind prefix** and `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Carousel

We've added a fully featured carousel component with motion, swipe gestures and keyboard support. Built on top of [Embla Carousel](https://www.embla-carousel.com).

It has support for infinite looping, autoplay, vertical orientation, and more.

### Drawer

Oh the drawer component. Built on top of [Vaul](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul) by [emilkowalski](https://twitter.com/emilkowalski).

Try opening the following drawer on mobile. It looks amazing!

### Pagination

We've added a pagination component with page navigation, previous and next buttons. Simple, flexible and works with your framework's `<Link />` component.

### Resizable

Build resizable panel groups and layouts with this `<Resizable />` component.

<ComponentPreview name="resizable-demo-with-handle" />

`<Resizable />` is built using [react-resizable-panels](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels) by [bvaughn](https://github.com/bvaughn). It has support for mouse, touch and keyboard.

### Sonner

Another one by [emilkowalski](https://twitter.com/emilkowalski). The last toast component you'll ever need. Sonner is now availabe in shadcn/ui.

### CLI updates

This has been one of the most requested features. You can now configure a custom Tailwind prefix and the cli will automatically prefix your utility classes when adding components.

This means you can now easily add shadcn/ui components to existing projects like Docusaurus, Nextra...etc. A drop-in for your existing design system with no conflict.

```tsx /tw-/
<AlertDialog className="tw-grid tw-gap-4 tw-border tw-bg-background tw-shadow-lg" />
```

It works with `cn`, `cva` and CSS variables.

The cli can now also detect `tailwind.config.ts` and add the TypeScript version of the config for you.

That's it. Happy Holidays.
