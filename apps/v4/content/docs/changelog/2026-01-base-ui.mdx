When we launched `npx shadcn create` in December, we introduced the ability to choose between Radix and Base UI as your component library. Today, we're following up with complete documentation for all Base UI components.

### What's New

- **Full Base UI docs** - Every component now has dedicated documentation for Base UI, covering usage, props, and examples.
- **Rebuilt examples** - All component examples have been rebuilt for both Radix and Base UI. Switch between them to see the implementation differences.
- **Side-by-side comparison** - The docs make it easy to compare how components work across both libraries.

### Same Abstraction, Different Primitives

The goal remains the same: give you a consistent API regardless of which primitive library you choose. The components look and behave the same way. Only the underlying implementation changes.

```tsx
// Works the same whether you're using Radix or Base UI.
import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogTrigger } from "@/components/ui/dialog"
```

If you're starting a new project, run `npx shadcn create` and pick your preferred library. The CLI handles the rest.

<Button asChild size="sm">
  <Link href="/create" className="mt-6 no-underline!">
    Try shadcn/create
  </Link>
</Button>
