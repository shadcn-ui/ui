One of the most requested features since launch has been layouts: admin dashboards with sidebar, marketing page sections, cards and more.

**Today, we're launching [**Blocks**](/blocks)**.

    className="mt-6 hidden w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border shadow-sm dark:block"
  />
  <span className="sr-only">View the blocks library</span>
</a>

Blocks are ready-made components that you can use to build your apps. They are fully responsive, accessible, and composable, meaning they are built using the same principles as the rest of the components in shadcn/ui.

We're starting with dashboard layouts and authentication pages, with plans to add more blocks in the coming weeks.

### Open Source

Blocks are open source. You can find the source on GitHub. Use them in your projects, customize them and contribute back.

  />
  <span className="sr-only">View the blocks library</span>
</a>

### Request a Block

We're also introducing a "Request a Block" feature. If there's a specific block you'd like to see, simply create a request on GitHub and the community can upvote and build it.

    height="420"
    alt="Settings Page"
    className="mt-6 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border dark:hidden"
  />

  />
  <span className="sr-only">View the blocks library</span>

### v0

If you have a [v0](https://v0.dev) account, you can use the **Edit in v0** feature to open the code on v0 for prompting and further generation.

That's it. _Looking forward to seeing what you build with Blocks_.
