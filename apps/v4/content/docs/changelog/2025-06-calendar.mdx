We've upgraded the `Calendar` component to the latest version of [React DayPicker](https://daypicker.dev).

This is a major upgrade and includes a lot of new features and improvements. We've also built a collection of 30+ calendar blocks that you can use to build your own calendar components.

See all calendar blocks in the [Blocks Library](/blocks/calendar) page.
