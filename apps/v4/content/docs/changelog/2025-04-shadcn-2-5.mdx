We tagged shadcn 2.5.0 earlier this week. It comes with a pretty cool feature: **resolve anywhere**.

Registries can now place files anywhere in an app and we'll properly resolve imports. No need to stick to a fixed file structure. It can even add files outside the registry itself.

On install, we track all files and perform a multi-pass resolution to correctly handle imports and aliases. It's fast.
