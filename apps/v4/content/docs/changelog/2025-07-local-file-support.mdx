The shadcn CLI now supports local files. Initialize projects and add components, themes, hooks, utils and more from local JSON files.

```bash
# Initialize a project from a local file
npx shadcn init ./template.json

# Add a component from a local file
npx shadcn add ./block.json
```

This feature enables powerful new workflows:

- **Zero setup** - No remote registries required
- **Faster development** - Test registry items locally before publishing
- **Enhanced workflow for agents and MCP** - Generate and run registry items locally
- **Private components** - Keep proprietary components local and private.
