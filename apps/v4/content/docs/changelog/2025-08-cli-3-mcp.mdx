We just shipped shadcn CLI 3.0 with support for namespaced registries, advanced authentication, new commands and a completely rewritten registry engine.

### What's New

- [Namespaced Registries](#namespaced-registries) - Install components using `@registry/name` format.
- [Private Registries](#private-registries) - Secure your registry with advanced authentication.
- [Search & Discovery](#search--discovery) - New commands to find and view code before installing.
- [MCP Server](#mcp-server) - MCP server for all registries.
- [Faster Everything](#faster-everything) - Completely rewritten registry resolution.
- [Improved Error Handling](#improved-error-handling) - Better error messages for users and LLMs.
- [Upgrade Guide](#upgrade-guide) - Migration notes for existing users.

### Namespaced Registries

The biggest change in 3.0 is namespaced registries. You can now install components from registries: a community registry, your company's private registry or internal registry, using the `@registry/name` format.

This makes it easier to distribute code across teams and projects.

Configure registries in your `components.json`:

```json title="components.json"
{
  "registries": {
    "@acme": "https://acme.com/r/{name}.json",
    "@internal": {
      "url": "https://registry.company.com/{name}",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${REGISTRY_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then use the `@registry/name` format to install components:

```bash
npx shadcn add @acme/button @internal/auth-system
```

It's completely decentralized. There's no central registrar. Create any namespace you want and organize components however makes sense for your team.

```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "registries": {
    "@design": "https://registry.company.com/create/{name}.json",
    "@engineering": "https://registry.company.com/eng/{name}.json",
    "@marketing": "https://registry.company.com/marketing/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

Components can even depend on resources from different registries. Everything gets resolved and installed automatically from the right sources.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "dashboard",
  "type": "registry:block",
  "registryDependencies": [
    "@shadcn/card", // From default registry
    "@v0/chart", // From v0 registry
    "@acme/data-table", // From acme registry
    "@lib/data-fetcher", // Utility library
    "@ai/analytics-prompt" // AI prompt resource
  ]
}
```

### Private Registries

Need to keep your components private? We've got you covered. Configure authentication with tokens, API keys, or custom headers:

```json title="components.json"
{
  "registries": {
    "@private": {
      "url": "https://registry.company.com/{name}.json",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${REGISTRY_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Your private components stay private. Perfect for enterprise teams with proprietary UI libraries.

We support all major authentication methods: basic auth, bearer token, api key query params and custom headers.

See the [authentication docs](/docs/registry/authentication) for more details.

### Search & Discovery

Three new commands make it easy to find exactly what you need:

1. View items from the registry before installing

```bash
npx shadcn view @acme/auth-system
```

2. Search items from registries

```bash
npx shadcn search @tweakcn -q "dark"
```

3. List all items from a registry

```bash
npx shadcn list @acme
```

Preview components before installing them. Search across multiple registries. See the code and all dependencies upfront.

### MCP Server

Back in April, we [introduced](https://x.com/shadcn/status/1917597228513853603) the first version of the MCP server. Since then, we've taken everything we learned and built a better MCP server.

Here's what's new:

- Works with all registries. Zero config
- One command to add to your favorite MCP clients
- We improved the underlying tools
- Better integration with the CLI and registries
- Support for multiple registries in the same project

Add the MCP server to your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest mcp init
```

See the [docs](/docs/mcp) for more details.

### Faster Everything

We completely rewrote the registry resolution engine from scratch. It's faster, smarter, and handles even the trickiest dependency trees.

- Up to 3x faster dependency resolution
- Smarter file deduplication and merging
- Better monorepo support out of the box
- Updated `build` command for registry authors

### Improved Error Handling

Registry developers can now provide custom error messages to help guide users (and LLMs) when things go wrong. The CLI displays helpful, actionable errors for common issues:

```txt
Unknown registry "@acme". Make sure it is defined in components.json as follows:
{
  "registries": {
    "@acme": "[URL_TO_REGISTRY]"
  }
}
```

Missing environment variables? The CLI tells you exactly what's needed:

```txt
Registry "@private" requires the following environment variables:
  • REGISTRY_TOKEN

Set the required environment variables to your .env or .env.local file.
```

Registry authors can provide custom error messages in their responses to help users and AI agents understand and fix issues quickly.

```txt
Error:
You are not authorized to access the item at http://example.com/r/component.

Message:
[Unauthorized] Your API key has expired. Renew it at https://example.com/api/renew-key.
```

### Upgrade Guide

Here's the best part: there are no breaking changes for users. Your existing `components.json` works exactly the same. All your installed components work exactly the same.

For developers, if you're using the programmatic APIs directly, we've deprecated a few functions in favor of better ones:

- `fetchRegistry` → `getRegistry`
- `resolveRegistryTree` → `resolveRegistryItems`
- Schema moved from `shadcn/registry` to `shadcn/schema` package

```diff
- import { registryItemSchema } from "shadcn/registry"
+ import { registryItemSchema } from "shadcn/schema"
```

That's it. Seriously. Everything else just works.
