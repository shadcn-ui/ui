description: A new command to migrate to the new radix-ui package.

We've added a new command to migrate to the new `radix-ui` package. This command will replace all `@radix-ui/react-*` imports with `radix-ui`.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest migrate radix
```

It will automatically update all imports in your `ui` components and install `radix-ui` as a dependency.

```diff showLineNumbers title="components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx"
- import * as AlertDialogPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-dialog"
+ import { AlertDialog as AlertDialogPrimitive } from "radix-ui"
```

Make sure to test your components and project after running the command.

**Note:** To update imports for newly added components, run the migration command again.
