We've added support for universal registry items. This allows you to create registry items that can be distributed to any project i.e. no framework, no components.json, no tailwind, no react required.

This new registry item type unlocks a lot of new workflows. You can now distribute code, config, rules, docs, anything to any code project.

See the [docs](/docs/registry/examples) for more details and examples.
