Until now, using shadcn/ui in a monorepo was a bit of a pain. You could add
components using the CLI, but you had to manage where the components
were installed and manually fix import paths.

With the new monorepo support in the CLI, we've made it a lot easier to use
shadcn/ui in a monorepo.

The CLI now understands the monorepo structure and will install the components,
dependencies and registry dependencies to the correct paths and handle imports
for you.
