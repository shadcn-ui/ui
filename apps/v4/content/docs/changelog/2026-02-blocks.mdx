All [blocks](/blocks) are now available for both Radix and Base UI.

- **All blocks for both libraries** - Every block, including login, signup, sidebar and dashboard blocks, is now available in both Radix and Base UI variants.
- **Same CLI workflow** - Run `npx shadcn add` and the CLI will pull the correct block variant based on your project configuration.

If you've already set up your project with `npx shadcn create`, blocks will automatically use your chosen library. No additional configuration needed.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add login-01
```

Browse the full collection on the [blocks](/blocks) page.
