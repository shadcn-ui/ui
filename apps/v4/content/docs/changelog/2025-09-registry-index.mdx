title: September 2025 - Registry Index
description: An index of open source registries that you can install items from.

We've created an index of open source registries that you can install items from.

You can search, view and add items from the registry index without configuring the `.components.json` file.

They'll be automatically added to your `components.json` file for you.

```bash
npx shadcn add @ai-elements/prompt-input
```

The full list of registries is available at [https://ui.shadcn.com/r/registries.json](https://ui.shadcn.com/r/registries.json).

To add a registry to the index, submit a PR to the `shadcn/ui` repository. See the [registry index documentation](/docs/registry/registry-index) for more details.
