description: MCP support for registry developers
---

The [shadcn MCP server](/docs/mcp) works out of the box with any shadcn-compatible registry. You do not need to do anything special to enable MCP support for your registry.

---

## Prerequisites

The MCP server works by requesting your registry index. Make sure you have a registry item file at the root of your registry named `registry`.

For example, if your registry is hosted at `https://acme.com/r/[name].json`, you should have a file at `https://acme.com/r/registry.json` or `https://acme.com/r/registry` if you're using a JSON file extension.

This file must be a valid JSON file that conforms to the [registry schema](/docs/registry/registry-json).

## Configuring MCP

Ask your registry consumers to configure your registry in their `components.json` file and install the shadcn MCP server:

  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="claude">Claude Code</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="cursor">Cursor</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="vscode">VS Code</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="codex">Codex</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="claude" className="mt-4">
    **Configure your registry** in your `components.json` file:

    ```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
    {
      "registries": {
        "@acme": "https://acme.com/r/{name}.json"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Run the following command** in your project:

    ```bash
    npx shadcn@latest mcp init --client claude
    ```

    **Restart Claude Code** and try the following prompts:
       - Show me the components in the acme registry
       - Create a landing page using items from the acme registry

    **Note:** You can use `/mcp` command in Claude Code to debug the MCP server.

    **Configure your registry** in your `components.json` file:

    ```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
    {
      "registries": {
        "@acme": "https://acme.com/r/{name}.json"
      }
    }
    ```
    **Run the following command** in your project:
       ```bash
       npx shadcn@latest mcp init --client cursor
       ```

    Open **Cursor Settings** and **Enable the MCP server** for shadcn. Then try the following prompts:
       - Show me the components in the acme registry
       - Create a landing page using items from the acme registry

  <TabsContent value="vscode" className="mt-4">
    **Configure your registry** in your `components.json` file:

    ```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
    {
      "registries": {
        "@acme": "https://acme.com/r/{name}.json"
      }
    }
    ```
    **Run the following command** in your project:
       ```bash
       npx shadcn@latest mcp init --client vscode
       ```

    Open `.vscode/mcp.json` and click **Start** next to the shadcn server. Then try the following prompts with GitHub Copilot:
       - Show me the components in the acme registry
       - Create a landing page using items from the acme registry

  </TabsContent>

  <TabsContent value="codex" className="mt-4">
    **Configure your registry** in your `components.json` file:

    ```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
    {
      "registries": {
        "@acme": "https://acme.com/r/{name}.json"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Add the following configuration** to `~/.codex/config.toml`:
       ```toml
       [mcp_servers.shadcn]
       command = "npx"
       args = ["shadcn@latest", "mcp"]
       ```

    **Restart Codex** and try the following prompts:
       - Show me the components in the acme registry
       - Create a landing page using items from the acme registry

</Tabs>

You can read more about the MCP server in the [MCP documentation](/docs/mcp).

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices for MCP-compatible registries:

1. **Clear Descriptions**: Add concise, informative descriptions that help AI assistants understand what a registry item is for and how to use it.
2. **Proper Dependencies**: List all `dependencies` accurately so MCP can install them automatically.
3. **Registry Dependencies**: Use `registryDependencies` to indicate relationships between items.
4. **Consistent Naming**: Use kebab-case for component names and maintain consistency across your registry.
