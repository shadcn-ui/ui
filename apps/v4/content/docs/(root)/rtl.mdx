shadcn/ui components have first-class support for right-to-left (RTL) layouts. Text alignment, positioning, and directional styles automatically adapt for languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian.

When you install components, the CLI automatically transforms physical positioning classes to logical equivalents, so your components work seamlessly in both LTR and RTL contexts.

## Example

Here's a preview of a card component in RTL mode. Use the language switcher to switch the language. To see more examples, look for the RTL section on components pages.

<ComponentPreview
  styleName="base-nova"
  name="card-rtl"
  direction="rtl"
  previewClassName="h-auto"
  hideCode
  caption="A card component in RTL mode."
  className="mb-8"
/>

## Setup

<Steps>

<Step>Update your components.json</Step>

Add `direction: "rtl"` to your `components.json` file:

```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "base-nova",
  "direction": "rtl",
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "src/app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "neutral"
    ...
  }
}
```

<Step>Add the DirectionProvider</Step>

Wrap your application with the `DirectionProvider` component. Follow the installation guide for your UI library:

- [Direction for Radix UI](/docs/components/radix/direction)
- [Direction for Base UI](/docs/components/base/direction)

<Step>Set the dir attribute</Step>

Add the `dir="rtl"` attribute to your `html` element:

```tsx
<html dir="rtl">
  <body>
    <DirectionProvider dir="rtl">{/* Your app content */}</DirectionProvider>
  </body>
</html>
```

</Steps>

## How it works

When you install new components with `direction: "rtl"` set in your `components.json`, the shadcn CLI automatically transforms classes and props to be RTL compatible:

- Physical positioning classes like `left-*` and `right-*` are converted to logical equivalents like `start-*` and `end-*`.
- Directional props are updated to use logical values.
- Text alignment and spacing classes are adjusted accordingly.

## Supported Styles

Automatic RTL transformation via the CLI is only available for projects created using `shadcn create` with the new styles (`base-nova`, `radix-nova`, etc.).

For other styles, see the [Migration Guide](#migrating-existing-components).

## Migrating existing components

If you have existing components installed before enabling RTL, you can migrate them using the CLI as follows:

<Steps>

<Step>Add direction to your components.json</Step>

```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers {4}
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "direction": "rtl",
  ...
}
```

<Step>Run the migrate command</Step>

```bash
npx shadcn@latest migrate rtl
```

</Steps>
