# FAILURE DRILL MATRIX

| Failure Scenario | Trigger Condition | Expected System Response | Control State Outcome | Audit Evidence Required |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Control State Service Unavailable | Service health check fails OR response timeout >500ms | ALL operations blocked until service restored; assume MANUAL_ONLY | System transitions to MANUAL_ONLY; autonomous operations denied | Service downtime log, blocked operation count, state assumption timestamp, recovery timestamp |
| Audit Logging Service Failure | Audit write failure OR log verification failure | ALL write operations blocked immediately system-wide | No state transition; KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE behavior enforced | Write blocking timestamp, blocked transaction count, audit service restoration proof, zero writes verified |
| Database Constraint Violation | Domain authority check fails at DB layer | Transaction rollback; operation denied; CTO+CRO alert triggered | No state change; enforcement at DB layer | Failed transaction log, constraint violation details, rollback confirmation, executive notification proof |
| Integration Authentication Failure | External system auth token invalid OR expired | ALL inbound writes quarantined; outbound writes suspended | System remains in current state; integration layer fail-closed | Quarantined request log, auth failure details, integration suspension timestamp, manual review queue |
| Validation Hook Bypass Attempt | Control state validation skipped OR hardcoded override detected | Operation denied; immediate CRO escalation; user access suspended | System remains in current state; bypass logged as security event | Bypass attempt log, denied operation details, CRO notification timestamp, user suspension confirmation |
| Concurrent Kill-Switch Activation | Multiple executives attempt simultaneous kill-switch activation | First valid activation accepted; subsequent attempts logged; system freezes | System transitions to KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE; all writes blocked | First activation timestamp, authorizing executive ID, subsequent attempt log, write freeze proof (zero writes) |
| Network Partition (Split Brain Risk) | API Gateway loses connectivity to Control State Service | All nodes assume MANUAL_ONLY; writes blocked; manual operations require approval token | Each partition assumes MANUAL_ONLY independently | Per-node state assumption log, blocked write count per partition, partition detection timestamp, reunion reconciliation |
| Financial Transaction Mid-Flight During State Transition | Control state transitions to KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE while financial posting in progress | In-flight transaction aborted within 5 seconds; rollback executed; reconciliation run | System completes transition to KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE | Transaction abort timestamp, rollback confirmation, pre/post-abort balance verification, reconciliation report |
