# PHASE 4.0: EXTERNAL AUTONOMY BOUNDARY

**Document Classification:** Internal Policy — Binding  
**Effective Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Authority:** CTO, CISO, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Head of Enterprise Architecture  
**Audience:** CEO, CTO, CISO, CFO, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Board Audit Committee  
**Related Policies:** Phase 3.0 Autonomous Operations, Phase 3.1 Risk Assessment Matrix, Phase 1.3 Audit & Traceability, Phase 1.1 Governance Framework

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the **mandatory governance policy for external autonomy** — how external systems, vendors, AI agents, and partners are permitted to interact with, access, or act upon the organization's systems and data.

**This is a security, risk, and governance policy.**  
**This is not a technical integration guide.**  
**This is not a partnership agreement.**  
**This is the non-negotiable boundary of external control.**

**Core Principle:**  
**External systems are untrusted by default. Autonomy is granted sparingly, monitored continuously, and revoked immediately upon violation.**

**Fundamental Distinction:**
- **Internal Autonomy (Phase 3.x):** Organization's own systems acting autonomously (employees, processes, logic under organizational control)
- **External Autonomy (Phase 4.0):** External entities acting autonomously (vendors, partners, AI agents, third-party systems NOT under organizational control)

**Key Governance Commitments:**
1. **Zero Trust Model:** External systems start with zero permissions, earn limited privileges through validation
2. **Least Privilege:** External systems receive minimum necessary access, nothing more
3. **Explicit Boundaries:** Clear list of forbidden actions (no exceptions, no negotiations)
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Every external action logged, analyzed, and compared to authorized scope
5. **Immediate Revocation:** Any violation triggers instant access suspension (<60 seconds)
6. **No Autonomous Write to Critical Systems:** External systems cannot autonomously modify financial records, payroll, journal entries, or compliance data
7. **Contractual Enforcement:** Autonomy boundaries legally binding in vendor contracts

**Risk Reality:**
External autonomy is **fundamentally more dangerous** than internal autonomy:
- Organization has less control over external systems
- External systems may have conflicting incentives (vendor profit vs organizational safety)
- External breaches create legal, regulatory, and reputational exposure
- External system failures are harder to detect and remediate

Therefore: **External autonomy boundaries are stricter, monitoring is more intensive, and revocation is faster than internal autonomy controls.**

---

## PURPOSE & PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1 Why External Autonomy Requires Separate Governance

**Internal autonomy (Phase 3.x) assumptions:**
- Organization controls the logic
- Organization can modify behavior instantly
- Organization employs the humans accountable
- Organization owns the data and infrastructure

**External autonomy reality:**
- Organization does NOT control vendor/partner logic
- Organization CANNOT modify external system behavior directly
- Organization does NOT employ external system operators
- Organization does NOT own external infrastructure

**Conclusion:** External autonomy requires **stricter boundaries, deeper monitoring, and faster revocation** than internal autonomy.

---

### 1.2 Zero Trust Model for External Systems

**"Zero Trust" means:**
- External systems are untrusted by default
- Access is granted explicitly, never implicitly
- Permissions are narrowly scoped and time-limited
- Every action is logged and auditable
- Violations trigger immediate suspension

**No grandfathering.** No "trusted partner" exceptions. No "we've worked with them for years" exemptions.

**Every external system — regardless of relationship history — starts at zero trust and must prove itself.**

---

### 1.3 Least Privilege Principle

**External systems receive:**
- Minimum data access necessary to perform authorized function
- Minimum write permissions necessary (read-only preferred)
- Minimum API scope necessary (no "admin" or "full access" permissions)
- Time-limited access (reviewed quarterly, renewed annually)

**No "just in case" permissions.** No "maybe we'll need this later" access.

**If external system requests broader access:** Justify business need, demonstrate risk controls, obtain executive approval.

---

### 1.4 What This Policy Governs

**In Scope:**
- Vendor systems (SaaS platforms, payment processors, logistics providers)
- Partner systems (marketplace integrations, channel partners, affiliates)
- AI agents (external LLM APIs, decision engines, recommendation systems)
- Data exchanges (EDI, API integrations, data feeds)
- Consultants & contractors (external humans with system access)

**Out of Scope (Covered by Other Policies):**
- Internal employees (covered by Phase 1.1 Governance Framework)
- Internal systems (covered by Phase 3.x Autonomous Operations)
- Physical security (covered by separate physical security policy)

---

## EXTERNAL VS INTERNAL AUTONOMY (CLEAR DISTINCTION)

### 2.1 Internal Autonomy Definition (Phase 3.x)

**Internal autonomy = Organization's own systems acting autonomously.**

**Characteristics:**
- System logic owned and controlled by organization
- System runs on organization's infrastructure (or organization-controlled cloud)
- System operators are organization employees
- System decisions governed by internal policies (Phase 3.0-3.4)
- System failures contained within organizational boundary

**Examples:**
- Inventory reorder system automatically placing POs with suppliers
- Discount approval system automatically approving discounts within thresholds
- Fulfillment routing system automatically assigning orders to warehouses

**Governance:** Phase 3.0 (Autonomous Operations), Phase 3.1 (Risk Matrix), Phase 3.2 (Control Dashboard), Phase 3.3 (Incident Drills), Phase 3.4 (Promotion/Downgrade)

---

### 2.2 External Autonomy Definition (Phase 4.0)

**External autonomy = External systems acting autonomously on organization's behalf or with access to organization's systems/data.**

**Characteristics:**
- System logic owned and controlled by external entity (vendor, partner, third party)
- System runs on external infrastructure (not organization-controlled)
- System operators are external employees (not organization employees)
- System decisions governed by external policies (may conflict with organizational policies)
- System failures may cascade beyond organizational control

**Examples:**
- Payment processor automatically charging customer credit cards
- Shipping carrier automatically updating order tracking status
- Marketplace platform automatically listing organization's products
- AI agent (external LLM) automatically generating customer responses
- Accounting software (SaaS) automatically syncing transactions

**Governance:** This document (Phase 4.0 External Autonomy Boundary)

---

### 2.3 Critical Distinction: Trust & Control

| Dimension | Internal Autonomy | External Autonomy |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Control** | Full (organization controls logic) | Limited (vendor controls logic) |
| **Trust** | High (employees accountable) | Low (vendor incentives may differ) |
| **Visibility** | Full (access to source code, logs) | Partial (API logs only, no source access) |
| **Modifiability** | Immediate (organization can change logic) | Slow (requires vendor cooperation) |
| **Revocation** | Easy (disable feature flag) | Harder (contractual termination, data migration) |
| **Liability** | Organization (internal failures) | Shared (vendor breaches create legal exposure) |

**Implication:** External autonomy requires **stricter boundaries and faster revocation** because organization has less control and visibility.

---

### 2.4 The Boundary Rule

**All autonomy (internal or external) must stop at certain boundaries.**

**For internal autonomy (Phase 3.1):**
- Forbidden actions: Payroll calculation, tax computation, journal entries, regulatory filings
- Maximum tier based on risk: Critical risk = max Tier 1

**For external autonomy (Phase 4.0):**
- **All internal forbidden actions remain forbidden for external systems**
- **Additional external forbidden actions:** Write access to financial ledgers, modify user permissions, access employee PII (beyond authorized scope), execute payments without dual approval

**Rule:** If internal system cannot autonomously perform an action, external system **definitely** cannot.

**Corollary:** External systems have **narrower autonomy** than internal systems in all cases.

---

## EXTERNAL ENTITY CLASSIFICATION

### 3.1 Purpose

**Not all external entities are equally risky.**

Payment processor has different risk profile than marketing analytics tool.

Classification determines **maximum permitted autonomy and monitoring intensity**.

---

### 3.2 Classification Framework (4 Tiers)

#### Tier 1: Critical External Systems

**Definition:** External systems with write access to financial, compliance, or customer data.

**Examples:**
- Payment processors (charge customer cards, process refunds)
- Accounting software (sync transactions, create entries)
- Payroll providers (calculate wages, submit tax filings)
- Banking integrations (initiate payments, reconcile accounts)

**Risk Level:** 🔴 Critical

**Maximum Permitted Autonomy:**
- Read access: Allowed (with audit logging)
- Write access: Restricted to pre-approved operations only
- Autonomous write: Forbidden (dual approval required)

**Monitoring Intensity:** Real-time (every action logged and analyzed within 5 minutes)

**Review Cadence:** Quarterly access review, annual contract renewal

---

#### Tier 2: High-Risk External Systems

**Definition:** External systems with read access to sensitive data or ability to modify operational data.

**Examples:**
- Shipping carriers (update tracking, modify delivery addresses)
- Inventory management platforms (adjust stock levels)
- CRM integrations (create/update customer records)
- E-commerce marketplaces (list products, update pricing)

**Risk Level:** 🟠 High

**Maximum Permitted Autonomy:**
- Read access: Allowed (sensitive data only if justified)
- Write access: Allowed (limited scope, e.g., update tracking status)
- Autonomous write: Conditional (within guardrails, e.g., update tracking but not customer PII)

**Monitoring Intensity:** Near real-time (every action logged, analyzed daily)

**Review Cadence:** Semi-annual access review, annual contract renewal

---

#### Tier 3: Moderate-Risk External Systems

**Definition:** External systems with read-only access to non-sensitive data or limited write access to non-critical data.

**Examples:**
- Analytics platforms (read sales data, product data)
- Marketing automation (read customer contact info, send emails)
- Reporting tools (read operational metrics)
- AI recommendation engines (read product catalog, suggest recommendations)

**Risk Level:** 🟡 Moderate

**Maximum Permitted Autonomy:**
- Read access: Allowed (non-sensitive data)
- Write access: Allowed (low-risk data only, e.g., email delivery status)
- Autonomous write: Allowed (non-critical actions, e.g., log events)

**Monitoring Intensity:** Batch (actions logged, analyzed weekly)

**Review Cadence:** Annual access review, multi-year contract acceptable

---

#### Tier 4: Low-Risk External Systems

**Definition:** External systems with no direct access to organizational data (organization pushes data to them) or read-only access to public/non-sensitive data.

**Examples:**
- Web analytics (organization pushes anonymized page views)
- Public-facing APIs (external systems read public product catalog)
- Social media platforms (organization posts content, external system displays)

**Risk Level:** 🟢 Low

**Maximum Permitted Autonomy:**
- Read access: Public data only
- Write access: None (organization pushes data unidirectionally)
- Autonomous write: Not applicable

**Monitoring Intensity:** Light (periodic review of data pushed)

**Review Cadence:** Biennial access review

---

### 3.3 Classification Decision Authority

**Who classifies external systems:**
- **Tier 1 (Critical):** CISO + Chief Risk Officer + Chief Legal Officer (all three must agree)
- **Tier 2 (High):** CISO + Chief Risk Officer
- **Tier 3 (Moderate):** CISO
- **Tier 4 (Low):** Integration Owner (with CISO notification)

**Reclassification:** Any tier change (up or down) requires same authority as initial classification.

**Default:** If classification unclear, default to **Tier 1 (most restrictive)** until proper assessment complete.

---

## AUTHORIZATION FRAMEWORK (WHAT EXTERNAL SYSTEMS CAN DO)

### 4.1 Purpose

Define **explicit permissions** external systems may have. No implicit permissions.

---

### 4.2 Read Permissions (Data Access)

**External systems may read data ONLY if:**
1. Business justification documented (why does vendor need this data?)
2. Data minimization applied (vendor receives minimum necessary data)
3. Legal basis exists (contract, consent, legitimate interest)
4. Audit logging enabled (every read operation logged)

**Data access tiers:**

| Data Sensitivity | Tier 1 External Systems | Tier 2 External Systems | Tier 3 External Systems | Tier 4 External Systems |
|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Public data** | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |
| **Customer contact info** | Allowed (justified) | Allowed (justified) | Allowed (justified) | Forbidden |
| **Order/transaction data** | Allowed (justified) | Allowed (limited scope) | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Financial data** | Allowed (payment processor only) | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Employee PII** | Forbidden (unless payroll provider) | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Authentication credentials** | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Audit logs** | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |

**Rule:** If data is forbidden for internal Tier 3+ autonomy (Phase 3.1), it is **forbidden for all external systems** unless explicitly whitelisted.

---

### 4.3 Write Permissions (Data Modification)

**External systems may write data ONLY if:**
1. Write operation explicitly authorized (no "read/write" blanket permissions)
2. Write scope narrowly defined (which fields, which records)
3. Write operations auditable (before/after state logged)
4. Write operations reversible (rollback mechanism exists)

**Write permission classification:**

| Write Operation | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Update tracking status** | Allowed | Allowed | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Create customer contact** | Allowed (conditional) | Allowed (conditional) | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Modify product pricing** | Forbidden (dual approval) | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Create financial transaction** | Forbidden (dual approval) | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Modify user permissions** | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Delete records** | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |

**Dual Approval Rule:** Any write operation affecting financial, compliance, or security-sensitive data requires dual approval (external system proposes, internal human approves).

---

### 4.4 Execute Permissions (Action Initiation)

**External systems may initiate actions ONLY if:**
1. Action explicitly authorized in contract and integration agreement
2. Action scope bounded (e.g., "charge customer card up to $X")
3. Action logged and auditable
4. Action subject to guardrails (rate limits, value limits, time windows)

**Permitted actions by tier:**

| Action | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Charge customer payment** | Allowed (within authorized amount) | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Send email to customer** | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed | Forbidden |
| **Update inventory level** | Forbidden (internal only) | Allowed (restricted) | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Create purchase order** | Forbidden (internal only) | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Initiate refund** | Allowed (conditional, with limits) | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Modify accounting ledger** | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |

**Rule:** If action is forbidden for internal autonomy (Phase 3.1), it is **forbidden for all external systems** without exception.

---

### 4.5 Permission Grant Process

**External systems do NOT self-register permissions.**

**Permission grant requires:**
1. **Integration Request:** Vendor or Domain Owner submits formal integration request
2. **Risk Assessment:** CISO + Chief Risk Officer assess risk (classify entity tier, evaluate permissions)
3. **Legal Review:** Chief Legal Officer reviews contract, SLA, liability provisions
4. **Technical Review:** Enterprise Architect validates technical controls (API security, rate limits, audit logging)
5. **Executive Approval:** CTO + CISO approve (Tier 1-2) or CTO + CISO + CEO approve (Tier 1 with write access)
6. **Pilot Deployment:** Limited-scope pilot (30-90 days) before full deployment
7. **Full Authorization:** Post-pilot authorization with ongoing monitoring

**Timeline:** 30-90 days from integration request to full authorization (no shortcuts for "urgent" integrations).

---

## FORBIDDEN EXTERNAL ACTIONS (ABSOLUTE BOUNDARIES)

### 5.1 Purpose

**Define actions external systems are NEVER permitted to perform.**

No exceptions. No executive override. No "trusted partner" waiver.

---

### 5.2 Forbidden Financial Actions

**External systems are FORBIDDEN from autonomously:**
1. **Creating journal entries** (all journal entries require internal authorization)
2. **Modifying general ledger** (ledger modifications are internal-only)
3. **Posting revenue recognition** (revenue recognition requires internal accounting approval)
4. **Adjusting account balances** (balance adjustments are internal-only)
5. **Creating/modifying budgets** (budgeting is internal governance process)
6. **Initiating payments >$10K** (large payments require dual internal approval)
7. **Modifying tax calculations** (tax logic is internal-only or audited third-party)
8. **Creating invoices** (invoicing requires internal approval or explicit authorization per-invoice)

**Exception:** Payment processors may charge customer cards **within pre-authorized amounts and guardrails** (e.g., subscription billing for known amounts, order payments for validated orders).

---

### 5.3 Forbidden Compliance Actions

**External systems are FORBIDDEN from autonomously:**
1. **Submitting regulatory filings** (all regulatory filings require internal legal/compliance review)
2. **Creating audit trails** (audit logs generated by internal systems only; external systems may be logged but cannot create logs)
3. **Modifying compliance policies** (policies governed internally per Phase 1.1)
4. **Granting data access exemptions** (data access governed by internal DPO/legal)
5. **Approving GDPR/CCPA requests** (privacy requests require internal legal review)
6. **Generating compliance reports** (compliance reporting is internal function)

**Rationale:** Compliance accountability cannot be outsourced. External systems may support compliance, but internal teams must own compliance decisions.

---

### 5.4 Forbidden Security Actions

**External systems are FORBIDDEN from autonomously:**
1. **Creating user accounts** (user provisioning is internal HR/IT process)
2. **Modifying user permissions** (permission changes require internal authorization per Phase 1.1)
3. **Resetting passwords** (password resets are internal IT function)
4. **Accessing authentication credentials** (credentials never shared with external systems)
5. **Modifying security policies** (security policies governed by CISO)
6. **Disabling security controls** (security controls cannot be disabled by external systems)
7. **Accessing encryption keys** (encryption keys remain internal)

**Exception:** SSO providers may authenticate users **using federated identity** (not storing passwords), but cannot modify user permissions or access internal credentials.

---

### 5.5 Forbidden Data Actions

**External systems are FORBIDDEN from autonomously:**
1. **Deleting production data** (data deletion requires internal approval and backup validation)
2. **Modifying audit logs** (audit logs are immutable per Phase 1.3)
3. **Exporting bulk data without approval** (bulk exports require executive approval to prevent data exfiltration)
4. **Sharing data with fourth parties** (data sharing requires explicit internal authorization)
5. **Retaining data beyond contract term** (data retention governed by contract; vendor must delete data upon termination)
6. **Accessing data outside authorized scope** (no "exploratory access" or "testing in prod")

**Rationale:** Data sovereignty requires internal control. External systems are data processors, not data controllers.

---

### 5.6 Forbidden Operational Actions

**External systems are FORBIDDEN from autonomously:**
1. **Creating purchase orders >$50K** (large POs require internal procurement approval)
2. **Hiring/terminating employees** (HR actions are internal-only)
3. **Modifying payroll** (payroll changes require internal HR/Finance dual approval)
4. **Signing contracts** (contract signature authority per Phase 1.1 internal governance)
5. **Modifying approval workflows** (workflows governed by Phase 1.2)
6. **Overriding internal controls** (controls cannot be bypassed by external systems)

**Exception:** Payroll providers may calculate payroll **subject to internal review and approval** before funds disbursed.

---

### 5.7 Enforcement of Forbidden Actions

**Technical enforcement:**
- API endpoints for forbidden actions do not exist or return "403 Forbidden"
- Requests attempting forbidden actions logged as security events
- Repeated attempts trigger automatic access suspension

**Contractual enforcement:**
- Vendor contracts explicitly list forbidden actions
- Violation = material breach of contract
- Breach triggers immediate termination rights + potential legal action

**Monitoring:**
- All API requests analyzed for forbidden action attempts
- Security team alerted immediately upon attempted violation

---

## AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION (TECHNICAL CONTROLS)

### 6.1 Purpose

Define **technical mechanisms** that enforce external autonomy boundaries.

---

### 6.2 Authentication Requirements

**All external systems must authenticate using:**
- **API Keys** (minimum; time-limited, rotated quarterly)
- **OAuth 2.0** (preferred; scoped permissions, token expiration)
- **Mutual TLS** (for high-security integrations; certificate-based authentication)

**Forbidden authentication methods:**
- Username/password (too easily compromised)
- Shared credentials (no traceability)
- Long-lived tokens (>365 days without rotation)

**Authentication logging:**
- Every authentication attempt logged (success and failure)
- Failed authentication attempts trigger alerts (>5 failures in 1 hour = potential attack)

---

### 6.3 Authorization Model (Scoped Permissions)

**External systems receive:**
- **Least privilege scope:** Only APIs/data necessary for authorized function
- **Time-limited tokens:** OAuth tokens expire after 1-24 hours (require refresh)
- **IP whitelisting:** External system IPs whitelisted (requests from non-whitelisted IPs blocked)
- **Rate limiting:** Request volume capped (prevent abuse or compromise)

**Permission scopes defined per integration:**
- `read:products` (read product catalog)
- `write:tracking` (update shipment tracking)
- `execute:payment` (charge customer card within limits)
- `read:orders` (read order data, not customer PII)

**No "admin" or "full access" scopes for external systems.** Ever.

---

### 6.4 Token Rotation & Expiration

**API keys and tokens must:**
- **Expire:** Maximum 365 days (OAuth access tokens: 24 hours; refresh tokens: 90 days)
- **Rotate:** Quarterly rotation (organization generates new key, vendor updates)
- **Revoke:** Immediate revocation capability (in case of breach or contract termination)

**Rotation process:**
1. Organization generates new API key/token
2. Vendor notified 30 days in advance
3. Dual-key period (old + new both valid for 7 days)
4. Old key revoked after transition period

**If vendor fails to rotate:** Access suspended until rotation complete.

---

### 6.5 IP Whitelisting & Network Controls

**External systems must:**
- Provide static IP addresses or IP ranges for whitelisting
- Access APIs only from whitelisted IPs
- Notify organization 14 days before IP changes

**Requests from non-whitelisted IPs:**
- Blocked at firewall/API gateway
- Logged as security events
- Trigger alert to CISO

**Exception:** Cloud-based SaaS with dynamic IPs may use signed requests (cryptographic signature validates request authenticity).

---

### 6.6 API Gateway & Request Validation

**All external API requests pass through API gateway:**
- **Authentication:** Validate API key/token
- **Authorization:** Validate request scope (is external system authorized for this API?)
- **Rate limiting:** Enforce request volume limits
- **Input validation:** Reject malformed or suspicious requests
- **Logging:** Log all requests (success, failure, rejected)

**Gateway rules:**
- Reject requests with invalid authentication
- Reject requests outside authorized scope
- Reject requests exceeding rate limits
- Reject requests from non-whitelisted IPs
- Reject requests with malicious payloads (SQL injection, XSS attempts)

---

## DATA ACCESS BOUNDARIES (WHAT DATA EXTERNAL SYSTEMS SEE)

### 7.1 Purpose

**Control what data external systems can access.**

Even if external system is authenticated and authorized, it should only see data necessary for its function.

---

### 7.2 Data Minimization Principle

**External systems receive:**
- Minimum data fields necessary (not entire database records)
- Minimum records necessary (filtered dataset, not entire table)
- Anonymized/pseudonymized data when possible (real PII only if justified)

**Example:**
- Shipping carrier needs: Order ID, delivery address, customer name
- Shipping carrier does NOT need: Customer email, phone, payment info, order history

**Implementation:** API responses filtered to include only authorized fields.

---

### 7.3 Data Masking & Redaction

**Sensitive fields automatically masked for external systems:**
- **Credit card numbers:** Last 4 digits only (e.g., `****1234`)
- **Bank account numbers:** Last 4 digits only
- **Social security numbers:** Redacted entirely
- **Employee salaries:** Aggregated only (no individual salaries)
- **Passwords/secrets:** Never exposed via API

**Masking enforced at API gateway level** (not reliant on application logic).

---

### 7.4 Data Segmentation by External Entity Tier

**Data access varies by external entity classification:**

| Data Type | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Customer name** | Full | Full | Full | Forbidden |
| **Customer email** | Full | Masked (hash) | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Customer phone** | Full | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Order value** | Full | Full | Aggregated only | Forbidden |
| **Payment method** | Last 4 digits | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Product catalog** | Full | Full | Full | Public only |
| **Inventory levels** | Full | Full | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Employee data** | Forbidden (unless payroll) | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Financial ledger** | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |
| **Audit logs** | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |

---

### 7.5 Geographic Data Boundaries

**Data residency requirements:**
- Customer data must remain in customer's jurisdiction (GDPR, data localization laws)
- External systems processing EU customer data must be GDPR-compliant
- External systems may NOT transfer data to prohibited jurisdictions (per legal/compliance policy)

**Contractual requirement:** Vendor contracts specify data residency and cross-border transfer restrictions.

**Validation:** Periodic audits verify vendor compliance with data residency requirements.

---

### 7.6 Data Retention & Deletion

**External systems must:**
- Retain data only as long as necessary for authorized function
- Delete data upon contract termination (within 30 days)
- Provide proof of deletion (certification or audit report)

**Organization retains right to:**
- Audit vendor data retention practices
- Demand immediate data deletion (for compliance or security reasons)
- Terminate contract if vendor fails to delete data

---

## RATE LIMITING & THROTTLING (PREVENT ABUSE)

### 8.1 Purpose

**Prevent external systems from overloading APIs or exfiltrating data at scale.**

Even authorized external systems may misbehave (compromised credentials, logic error, malicious intent).

---

### 8.2 Rate Limit Tiers

**All external systems subject to rate limits:**

| External Entity Tier | Requests per Second | Requests per Day | Burst Allowance |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1 (Critical)** | 10 req/sec | 100,000 req/day | 50 req in 5 sec |
| **Tier 2 (High Risk)** | 5 req/sec | 50,000 req/day | 25 req in 5 sec |
| **Tier 3 (Moderate)** | 2 req/sec | 10,000 req/day | 10 req in 5 sec |
| **Tier 4 (Low Risk)** | 1 req/sec | 5,000 req/day | 5 req in 5 sec |

**Exceeding rate limit:**
- Requests rejected with `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status
- External system must back off (exponential backoff recommended)
- Persistent violations logged and escalated to CISO

---

### 8.3 Data Export Throttling

**Bulk data exports (>1,000 records) require:**
- Explicit approval (CTO + CISO for Tier 1-2 systems)
- Business justification (why bulk export needed?)
- Time window (export allowed only during specified maintenance window)
- Monitoring (bulk export logged and analyzed for anomalies)

**Unapproved bulk exports:**
- Blocked at API gateway
- Logged as security event
- External system access suspended pending investigation

---

### 8.4 Adaptive Rate Limiting

**Rate limits adjust based on behavior:**
- **Good behavior:** External system consistently operates within limits → rate limit may be increased (with approval)
- **Poor behavior:** External system frequently hits limits or exhibits suspicious patterns → rate limit decreased or access suspended

**Suspicious patterns:**
- Sudden spike in request volume (>10x normal)
- Requests during unusual hours (e.g., 2 AM local time for vendor with no 24/7 operations)
- Requests for data outside normal scope (e.g., requesting all customer records when vendor normally requests 10-50/day)

---

## AUDIT & TRACEABILITY (EVERY EXTERNAL ACTION LOGGED)

### 9.1 Purpose

**Every external system action must be auditable** (per Phase 1.3 requirements).

External actions carry higher risk than internal actions, therefore require deeper audit trails.

---

### 9.2 Logging Requirements

**Every external API request logged with:**
- **Timestamp** (exact time of request)
- **External entity identifier** (which vendor/partner)
- **Action performed** (API endpoint, operation)
- **Data accessed** (which records, which fields)
- **Result** (success, failure, rejection reason)
- **IP address** (source IP of request)
- **Authentication details** (API key ID, OAuth token ID)

**Log storage:**
- Logs immutable (per Phase 1.3)
- Logs retained for 7 years (compliance requirement)
- Logs accessible to internal audit and external auditors

---

### 9.3 Enhanced Logging for High-Risk Actions

**For Tier 1 external systems and write operations:**
- **Before state:** Record state before modification (e.g., order status = "pending")
- **After state:** Record state after modification (e.g., order status = "shipped")
- **Justification:** API request includes reason code (e.g., "shipment departed facility")

**Purpose:** Enable forensic analysis and rollback if external system misbehaves.

---

### 9.4 Real-Time Audit Monitoring

**External system logs analyzed in real-time:**
- **Anomaly detection:** Unusual patterns trigger alerts (volume spike, unauthorized API access)
- **Policy violation detection:** Attempts to perform forbidden actions logged and alerted
- **Data exfiltration detection:** Bulk data requests flagged for review

**Alert routing:**
- Minor anomalies → Security Operations Center (SOC) for investigation
- Major anomalies → CISO + CTO immediate notification
- Critical violations (forbidden action attempt) → CISO + CTO + Chief Legal Officer immediate notification + automatic access suspension

---

### 9.5 External Audit Access

**External auditors (financial, compliance, security) have:**
- Read-only access to external system audit logs
- Ability to query logs for specific external entities or time periods
- Reporting tools to analyze external system behavior patterns

**Auditor use cases:**
- Financial auditor validates payment processor transactions
- Compliance auditor validates data access aligns with privacy policies
- Security auditor validates no unauthorized access attempts

---

## VIOLATION DETECTION & RESPONSE

### 10.1 Purpose

**Detect when external systems violate autonomy boundaries and respond immediately.**

---

### 10.2 Violation Categories

#### Category 1: Forbidden Action Attempt

**Definition:** External system attempts action on forbidden list (Section 5).

**Examples:**
- Payment processor attempts to modify user permissions
- Shipping carrier attempts to delete order records
- Analytics platform attempts to access employee PII

**Detection:** API gateway rejects request; security event logged

**Response:**
1. **Immediate:** Request blocked (never executed)
2. **Alert:** CISO + CTO notified immediately
3. **Investigation:** Security team investigates within 4 hours (Was this malicious? Compromised credentials? Logic error?)
4. **Suspension:** Access suspended pending investigation (default; may be lifted if investigation shows benign error)

---

#### Category 2: Unauthorized Data Access

**Definition:** External system accesses data outside authorized scope.

**Examples:**
- Vendor authorized for "Order #12345" data requests "All orders"
- Vendor authorized for "read:products" requests customer financial data
- Vendor attempts to access API endpoint not in authorized scope list

**Detection:** API gateway rejects request; security event logged

**Response:**
1. **Immediate:** Request blocked
2. **Alert:** SOC investigates within 24 hours
3. **Escalation:** If pattern (>3 attempts in 7 days), escalate to CISO
4. **Suspension:** If persistent pattern, suspend access

---

#### Category 3: Rate Limit Violation

**Definition:** External system exceeds rate limits (Section 8).

**Examples:**
- Vendor makes 1,000 req/sec when limit is 10 req/sec
- Vendor makes 500K requests/day when limit is 100K req/day

**Detection:** API gateway throttles requests; rate limit event logged

**Response:**
1. **Immediate:** Requests throttled (rejected with 429 status)
2. **Notification:** Vendor notified via email (automated)
3. **Escalation:** If persistent (>3 days), CISO reviews for potential compromise or abuse
4. **Suspension:** If no justification, access suspended

---

#### Category 4: Authentication Failure

**Definition:** External system fails to authenticate properly.

**Examples:**
- Invalid API key
- Expired OAuth token
- Request from non-whitelisted IP

**Detection:** API gateway rejects request; authentication failure logged

**Response:**
1. **Immediate:** Request blocked
2. **Notification:** Vendor notified (automated; may be transient issue)
3. **Alert:** If >10 failures in 1 hour, alert SOC (potential credential theft attempt)
4. **Suspension:** If >100 failures in 1 hour, suspend API key and notify CISO (likely attack)

---

#### Category 5: Anomalous Behavior

**Definition:** External system behavior deviates significantly from baseline.

**Examples:**
- Request volume 10x higher than normal
- Requests during unusual time window (vendor normally operates 9 AM - 5 PM, suddenly requests at 3 AM)
- Requests for different data than usual (vendor normally requests orders, suddenly requests customer contact info)

**Detection:** Machine learning / rule-based anomaly detection

**Response:**
1. **Alert:** SOC investigates within 24 hours
2. **Vendor contact:** SOC contacts vendor to confirm activity is legitimate
3. **Suspension:** If vendor cannot confirm or activity deemed suspicious, suspend access pending investigation

---

### 10.3 Incident Response Workflow

**For all violations:**

**Step 1: Immediate Containment**
- Block violating request (prevent harm)
- Log violation details (audit trail)
- Suspend access if critical violation or pattern detected

**Step 2: Investigation**
- Security team investigates root cause (within 4-24 hours depending on severity)
- Contact vendor (ask for explanation)
- Review vendor logs (if accessible)

**Step 3: Classification**
- **Benign error:** Vendor logic bug, no malicious intent
- **Compromised credentials:** Vendor account compromised by attacker
- **Malicious activity:** Vendor intentionally violated boundaries

**Step 4: Resolution**
- **Benign error:** Vendor fixes logic, access restored after validation
- **Compromised credentials:** Vendor rotates credentials, access restored after security review
- **Malicious activity:** Contract terminated, access permanently revoked, legal action considered

**Step 5: Documentation**
- Incident report created (per Phase 3.3 incident documentation standards)
- Root cause documented
- Corrective actions logged
- Lessons learned shared with integration review team

## REVOCATION MECHANISMS (KILL-SWITCH FOR EXTERNAL ACCESS)

### 11.1 Purpose

**Enable immediate termination of external system access** when trust is lost.

Faster than internal autonomy kill-switches (external systems more dangerous).

---

### 11.2 Revocation Triggers (Automatic)

**External system access automatically suspended if:**
1. **Forbidden action attempt** (Category 1 violation)
2. **Repeated unauthorized access attempts** (>3 in 7 days)
3. **Massive rate limit violation** (>10x normal volume)
4. **Authentication failure pattern** (>100 failures in 1 hour)
5. **Vendor security breach notification** (vendor reports compromise to organization)
6. **Contract expiration** (access revoked automatically at end of contract term)

**Execution:** <60 seconds from trigger to full access suspension

---

### 11.3 Revocation Triggers (Manual)

**Executives may manually revoke external system access:**

**Authority to revoke:**
- **CISO:** Unilateral authority to suspend any external system for security reasons
- **Chief Legal Officer:** Unilateral authority to suspend for legal/compliance reasons (breach of contract, regulatory violation)
- **CTO:** Unilateral authority to suspend for operational reasons (vendor service degradation, integration failure)
- **CEO:** Unilateral authority to suspend any external system for any reason

**Revocation process:**
1. Executive triggers revocation (via dashboard, email to security team, or direct API call)
2. API gateway immediately revokes access (API keys/tokens invalidated)
3. Vendor notified (automated email: "Access suspended due to [reason]")
4. Executive team briefed (CISO + CTO + Chief Legal Officer notified within 1 hour)

**No waiting for consensus.** Any authorized executive can unilaterally suspend external access.

---

### 11.4 Revocation Scope

**Revocation can be:**
- **Full:** All access for external entity suspended (most common)
- **Partial:** Specific API scopes suspended (e.g., write access suspended, read access retained)
- **Temporary:** Time-limited suspension (e.g., 24-hour suspension during investigation)
- **Permanent:** Access never restored (contract terminated, vendor untrusted)

**Default:** Full suspension until investigation complete.

---

### 11.5 Revocation Execution

**Technical execution:**
1. **API key/token invalidation:** Vendor's credentials immediately invalidated in authentication system
2. **IP blacklisting:** Vendor IPs moved to blacklist (requests blocked at firewall)
3. **Session termination:** Active API sessions terminated
4. **Cache invalidation:** Cached permissions/tokens invalidated

**Execution time:** <60 seconds from revocation command to full access termination

**Validation:** Security team validates revocation within 5 minutes (test API request with vendor credentials to confirm rejection)

---

### 11.6 Access Restoration

**After revocation, access is NOT automatically restored.**

**Restoration requires:**
1. **Root cause resolution:** Issue that triggered revocation must be resolved
2. **Vendor confirmation:** Vendor confirms corrective actions implemented
3. **Security review:** CISO reviews vendor remediation
4. **Executive re-authorization:** CTO + CISO approve restoration (same authority that approved initial access)
5. **Pilot period:** Limited-scope restoration (30 days) before full access restored
6. **Enhanced monitoring:** Increased logging and alerting for 90 days post-restoration

**If restoration denied:** Contract terminated, vendor offboarded, data deletion verified.

---

## VENDOR CONTRACTS & SLAS (LEGAL REQUIREMENTS)

### 12.1 Purpose

**Ensure autonomy boundaries are legally enforceable**, not just technical controls.

If vendor violates boundaries, organization must have legal recourse.

---

### 12.2 Mandatory Contract Provisions

**All Tier 1-2 external system contracts must include:**

#### Provision 1: Scope of Authorized Access

**Contract explicitly lists:**
- Which APIs vendor may access
- Which data fields vendor may read
- Which operations vendor may perform
- Rate limits and usage caps

**Ambiguity = grounds for suspension.** If contract doesn't explicitly permit an action, vendor is forbidden from performing it.

---

#### Provision 2: Forbidden Actions

**Contract explicitly lists forbidden actions (per Section 5):**
- Actions vendor is absolutely prohibited from performing
- Violation = material breach of contract

**Material breach consequences:**
- Immediate termination rights for organization
- Liability for damages caused by violation
- Potential legal action

---

#### Provision 3: Data Protection & Privacy

**Contract requires vendor to:**
- Process data only as directed by organization (vendor is data processor, not controller)
- Implement appropriate security controls (encryption, access controls, logging)
- Notify organization of security breaches (within 24 hours)
- Delete data upon contract termination (within 30 days, with proof of deletion)
- Comply with applicable privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

**Vendor must provide:** Annual SOC 2 report or equivalent security audit.

---

#### Provision 4: Audit Rights

**Contract grants organization right to:**
- Audit vendor security practices (on-site or remote audit)
- Review vendor access logs (upon request)
- Verify data deletion (post-termination)

**Vendor must cooperate with audits** or face contract termination.

---

#### Provision 5: Liability & Indemnification

**Contract specifies:**
- Vendor liability for breaches or violations (financial cap or uncapped for gross negligence)
- Vendor indemnifies organization for third-party claims resulting from vendor actions
- Insurance requirements (cyber liability insurance, errors & omissions insurance)

**Purpose:** Ensure vendor has financial resources to compensate for harm caused by violation.

---

#### Provision 6: Termination Rights

**Contract grants organization right to:**
- Terminate for cause (violation of autonomy boundaries, security breach, material breach)
- Terminate for convenience (with notice period, e.g., 30-90 days)
- Immediate termination (for critical violations or compromised vendor)

**Post-termination:** Vendor must delete all organization data within 30 days.

---

### 12.3 Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

**SLAs define performance expectations:**

**Availability:** Vendor must maintain uptime (e.g., 99.9% uptime)

**Response time:** Vendor must respond to requests within acceptable latency (e.g., 95% of API requests <500ms)

**Support:** Vendor must provide support for integration issues (e.g., 24/7 support for Tier 1 systems, business hours for Tier 3)

**SLA breach consequences:**
- Service credits (financial compensation for downtime)
- Escalation to executive sponsor
- Termination rights (if persistent SLA breaches)

---

### 12.4 Legal Review Process

**All Tier 1-2 contracts reviewed by Chief Legal Officer before signing.**

**Legal review validates:**
- Autonomy boundaries clearly defined
- Forbidden actions explicitly listed
- Liability provisions adequate
- Termination rights enforceable
- Data protection provisions compliant with regulations

**If legal review fails:** Contract renegotiated or vendor rejected.

---

## INTEGRATION REVIEW PROCESS (BEFORE EXTERNAL SYSTEM GETS ACCESS)

### 13.1 Purpose

**Validate external system is trustworthy and integration is secure** before granting access.

---

### 13.2 Integration Request Initiation

**Who can request external integration:**
- Domain Owner (e.g., VP Operations requests shipping carrier integration)
- CTO (for enterprise-wide integrations)

**Request must include:**
- Business justification (why is integration necessary?)
- Vendor details (company name, contact, security certifications)
- Requested access (APIs, data, operations)
- Risk assessment (what could go wrong?)

---

### 13.3 Multi-Stage Review Process

#### Stage 1: Security Review (CISO)

**CISO evaluates:**
- Vendor security posture (Do they have SOC 2? ISO 27001? Security certifications?)
- Integration security (Is API secure? Authentication method adequate? Rate limiting defined?)
- Data protection (How will vendor protect organization's data?)

**Outcome:** Approve / Approve with conditions / Reject

---

#### Stage 2: Risk Review (Chief Risk Officer)

**Chief Risk Officer evaluates:**
- Business risk (What if vendor fails? What's the business impact?)
- Compliance risk (Does integration create regulatory exposure?)
- Financial risk (What's potential financial harm from vendor failure?)

**Outcome:** Approve / Approve with conditions / Reject

---

#### Stage 3: Legal Review (Chief Legal Officer)

**Chief Legal Officer evaluates:**
- Contract terms (Are liability provisions adequate?)
- Data processing agreement (Is vendor GDPR/CCPA compliant?)
- Intellectual property (Does vendor claim ownership of organization's data?)

**Outcome:** Approve / Approve with conditions / Reject

---

#### Stage 4: Technical Review (Enterprise Architect)

**Enterprise Architect evaluates:**
- Integration architecture (Is integration well-designed? Scalable? Maintainable?)
- API design (Does API follow best practices?)
- Monitoring (Can organization monitor vendor behavior?)

**Outcome:** Approve / Approve with conditions / Reject

---

#### Stage 5: Executive Approval (CTO + CISO)

**CTO + CISO review all prior evaluations:**
- If all stages approve → Grant integration approval
- If any stage rejects → Integration rejected (vendor not authorized)
- If conditions imposed → Integration proceeds with enhanced monitoring and restrictions

**For Tier 1 integrations (critical systems):** CEO must also approve.

---

### 13.4 Pilot Deployment

**After approval, integration deployed in pilot:**
- **Duration:** 30-90 days (depending on external entity tier)
- **Scope:** Limited (e.g., 10% of transactions, single warehouse, test data only)
- **Monitoring:** Enhanced (daily review of logs, weekly executive review)

**Pilot success criteria:**
- Zero security incidents
- Zero policy violations
- Performance meets SLAs
- No customer complaints related to integration

**If pilot fails:** Integration rejected, vendor access revoked, contract terminated or renegotiated.

---

### 13.5 Full Deployment Authorization

**After successful pilot:**
- Domain Owner + CTO + CISO sign full deployment authorization
- Integration scaled to 100% (or production scope)
- Enhanced monitoring continues for 90 days

**Post-deployment:**
- Quarterly access review (validate vendor still needs access)
- Annual contract renewal (renegotiate terms if needed)
- Annual security review (validate vendor still meets security standards)

---

## CONTINUOUS MONITORING (ONGOING OVERSIGHT)

### 14.1 Purpose

**External system access is not "set it and forget it."**

Ongoing monitoring ensures vendors remain trustworthy and compliant.

---

### 14.2 Automated Monitoring

**Real-time monitoring of:**
- API request volume (detect anomalies)
- Error rates (detect integration failures)
- Authentication failures (detect credential compromise)
- Policy violations (detect forbidden action attempts)
- Data access patterns (detect unauthorized data exfiltration)

**Alerts routed to:**
- Security Operations Center (SOC) for investigation
- CISO for critical violations
- Domain Owner for operational issues

---

### 14.3 Quarterly Access Review

**Every quarter, Domain Owner + CISO review:**
- Is vendor still needed? (Has business need changed?)
- Is vendor's access scope still appropriate? (Can access be reduced?)
- Has vendor had any security incidents? (External breach notifications?)
- Are SLAs being met? (Performance acceptable?)

**Outcome:**
- **Continue:** Access renewed for another quarter
- **Reduce:** Access scope reduced (narrower permissions)
- **Revoke:** Access terminated (vendor no longer needed or trustworthy)

---

### 14.4 Annual Security Review

**Every year, CISO reviews:**
- Vendor's security certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001 still valid?)
- Vendor's security posture (Any breaches? Security incidents?)
- Integration security (Are technical controls still adequate?)

**If security review fails:** Access suspended until vendor remediates or contract terminated.

---

### 14.5 Vendor Performance Scorecard

**Track vendor performance metrics:**
- **Uptime:** % availability (per SLA)
- **Latency:** API response time
- **Error rate:** % of failed requests
- **Security incidents:** Count of violations or near-misses
- **Compliance:** SOC 2 status, audit findings

**Scorecard reviewed quarterly.**

**Poor performance consequences:**
- Escalation to vendor executive sponsor
- Contract renegotiation
- Access suspension or termination

---

## INCIDENT RESPONSE (EXTERNAL SYSTEM COMPROMISE)

### 15.1 Purpose

**Define response when external system is compromised** (credentials stolen, vendor breached, malicious activity detected).

---

### 15.2 Incident Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Vendor Security Breach

**Trigger:** Vendor notifies organization of security breach (per contract requirement).

**Response:**
1. **Immediate:** Suspend vendor access (<60 seconds)
2. **Assessment:** CISO assesses impact (Was organization's data accessed? Exfiltrated? Modified?)
3. **Vendor coordination:** CISO coordinates with vendor CISO to understand breach scope
4. **Remediation:** Vendor must remediate breach before access restored
5. **Validation:** Organization audits vendor remediation (may require third-party security audit)
6. **Restoration:** Access restored only after CISO + CTO approve

**If breach affects organization's data:** Legal + Compliance notified (potential regulatory reporting required).

---

#### Scenario 2: Compromised Credentials

**Trigger:** Suspicious activity detected (e.g., requests from unusual IP, unusual hours, unusual data access patterns).

**Response:**
1. **Immediate:** Suspend vendor access
2. **Investigation:** Security team investigates (Was this legitimate vendor activity or attacker using stolen credentials?)
3. **Vendor contact:** Confirm with vendor (Did you make these requests?)
4. **Credential rotation:** Vendor generates new API keys/tokens
5. **Validation:** Organization validates new credentials secure (not same password/key reused)
6. **Restoration:** Access restored with new credentials + enhanced monitoring

**If credential theft confirmed:** Incident reported to law enforcement (if applicable).

---

#### Scenario 3: Malicious Vendor Activity

**Trigger:** Vendor intentionally violates autonomy boundaries (attempts forbidden actions, exfiltrates data, malicious behavior).

**Response:**
1. **Immediate:** Suspend vendor access permanently
2. **Legal:** Chief Legal Officer engaged (contract breach, potential legal action)
3. **Forensics:** Security team performs forensic analysis (What data accessed? What harm caused?)
4. **Data deletion:** Demand vendor delete all organization data immediately
5. **Contract termination:** Terminate contract for cause
6. **Legal action:** Pursue damages if harm caused

**Vendor never restored.** Organization will not work with malicious vendors.

---

#### Scenario 4: Mass External Compromise (Multiple Vendors)

**Trigger:** Industry-wide security event (e.g., supply chain attack, widespread vulnerability exploitation affecting multiple vendors).

**Response:**
1. **Assessment:** CISO assesses which vendors affected
2. **Selective suspension:** Suspend access for all affected vendors
3. **Industry coordination:** CISO participates in industry response (share threat intelligence)
4. **Vendor validation:** Each affected vendor must demonstrate remediation before restoration
5. **Staggered restoration:** Restore vendors one at a time (not all simultaneously) to manage risk

**Board notification:** CEO + Board informed of mass compromise and response.

---

### 15.3 Incident Documentation

**All external system incidents documented per Phase 3.3 standards:**
- Incident timeline
- Root cause analysis
- Actions taken
- Vendor response
- Lessons learned
- Policy/control improvements

**Incidents reviewed quarterly by Board Audit Committee.**

---

## INTEGRATION WITH GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

### 16.1 Relationship to Phase 1.3 (Audit & Traceability)

**Phase 1.3 requires immutable audit logs for all business actions.**

**Phase 4.0 extends this to external systems:**
- Every external API request logged (per Section 9)
- Logs immutable and retained for 7 years
- External system violations logged as security events

---

### 16.2 Relationship to Phase 3.1 (Risk Assessment Matrix)

**Phase 3.1 defines forbidden autonomy for internal systems.**

**Phase 4.0 applies same forbidden list to external systems** (plus additional external-specific restrictions):
- If internal system cannot autonomously perform action → external system forbidden
- External systems have narrower autonomy than internal systems in all cases

---

### 16.3 Relationship to Phase 3.2 (Control Dashboard)

**Phase 3.2 dashboard monitors internal autonomy.**

**Phase 4.0 requires parallel external autonomy dashboard:**
- Active external integrations (count, tier classification)
- External system violations (last 30 days)
- Top external systems by API volume
- Recent external access suspensions

**Dashboard reviewed by CISO + CTO monthly.**

---

### 16.4 Relationship to Phase 1.1 (Governance Framework)

**Phase 1.1 defines who can authorize internal actions.**

**Phase 4.0 defines who can authorize external system access:**
- CTO + CISO (Tier 2-4 integrations)
- CTO + CISO + CEO (Tier 1 integrations)

**Approval logged in decision log (same as internal governance decisions).**

---

## ACCOUNTABILITY & ENFORCEMENT

### 17.1 Executive Accountability

**CISO is accountable for:**
- External system security posture
- Timely review of integration requests
- Monitoring and violation detection
- Incident response for external compromises

**CTO is accountable for:**
- Technical adequacy of integrations
- API security and rate limiting
- Vendor performance management

**Chief Legal Officer is accountable for:**
- Contract enforceability
- Legal compliance of integrations
- Vendor liability provisions

**If accountability failure:** CEO intervention + Board escalation.

---

### 17.2 Vendor Accountability

**Vendors are contractually accountable for:**
- Compliance with autonomy boundaries
- Security of integration
- Data protection
- Notification of breaches

**Vendor breach consequences:**
- Financial liability (per contract)
- Contract termination
- Legal action
- Reputational harm (organization may publicly disclose vendor breach if material)

---

### 17.3 Board Oversight

**Board Audit Committee reviews quarterly:**
- External integration posture (how many external systems, tier distribution)
- External system violations (count, severity, remediation)
- Vendor security incidents (breaches affecting organization)
- Contract compliance (are vendors meeting obligations?)

**Board can:**
- Request policy revisions
- Mandate external security audit
- Suspend all Tier 1 integrations (if systemic risk)
- Replace CISO/CTO if governance failure

---

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### 18.1 Policy Review Cadence

**This policy reviewed:**
- **Annually:** By CISO + CTO + Chief Legal Officer (full policy review)
- **Quarterly:** By Integration Review Board (operational effectiveness)
- **On-demand:** After any major external system incident

**Review questions:**
- Are autonomy boundaries appropriate? (Too strict? Too lenient?)
- Are technical controls effective? (Rate limits, authentication, monitoring adequate?)
- Are contract provisions enforceable? (Have we successfully enforced contracts?)
- Are incident response procedures working? (Did we contain incidents quickly?)

---

### 18.2 Learning from External Incidents

**After every external system incident:**
- Root cause analysis (why did vendor violate boundary? Technical error? Malicious intent?)
- Control assessment (did technical controls work? Did monitoring detect violation?)
- Policy refinement (should policy be updated to prevent recurrence?)

**Goal:** Continuously improve external autonomy governance based on real-world incidents.

---

### 18.3 Industry Benchmarking

**Compare external autonomy controls to industry peers:**
- Are our boundaries stricter or looser than peers?
- Are our monitoring capabilities adequate?
- Are our contract provisions industry-standard?

**Sources:**
- Industry working groups (security consortiums, trade associations)
- Peer company collaboration (anonymized threat intelligence sharing)
- Security consultants (third-party assessment)

**Goal:** Learn from others' failures, adopt best practices.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

External systems are not internal systems with API access. External systems are untrusted entities requiring explicit authorization, continuous monitoring, and immediate revocation capability.

This policy exists to ensure that **external autonomy is granted sparingly, monitored intensively, and revoked instantly when trust is lost.**

The fundamental distinction:
- **Internal autonomy:** Organization controls the logic, owns the accountability
- **External autonomy:** Vendor controls the logic, organization retains accountability but has less control

Therefore: **External autonomy boundaries are stricter, monitoring is deeper, and revocation is faster than internal autonomy.**

**Key principles:**
1. **Zero trust:** External systems start with zero permissions, earn limited privileges
2. **Least privilege:** External systems receive minimum necessary access
3. **Explicit boundaries:** Clear forbidden actions (no exceptions)
4. **Continuous monitoring:** Every external action logged and analyzed
5. **Immediate revocation:** Violations trigger instant access suspension
6. **Contractual enforcement:** Autonomy boundaries legally binding

**Risk reality:** External system failures create:
- Security exposure (data breaches, credential theft)
- Compliance exposure (privacy violations, regulatory penalties)
- Financial exposure (unauthorized transactions, fraud)
- Reputational exposure (customer trust erosion)

**Governance response:** Strict boundaries, intensive monitoring, fast revocation.

When external systems respect boundaries, they enable organizational capability expansion.

When external systems violate boundaries, they create organizational risk.

This policy ensures boundaries are clear, violations are detected, and risk is contained.

**External systems are untrusted by default. Autonomy is granted sparingly, monitored continuously, and revoked immediately upon violation.**

Autonomy ends where organizational control ends. External systems operate at the boundary. This policy defines that boundary and enforces it without compromise.
