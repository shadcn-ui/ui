- MUST block ALL inbound write operations
- MUST block ALL outbound non-critical operations
- MUST permit health checks only
- MUST log assumed control state
- MUST trigger operational alert
- MUST return HTTP 503 to inbound requests

**NEVER:**
- Assume NORMAL state
- Proceed with write operations
- Use cached control state beyond 5-second TTL

---

### External System Inconsistent Data

**External system returns contradictory data:**

- MUST respect maximum retry limit
- MUST log all retry attempts
- MUST NOT retry operations marked as non-retryable

**External system returns HTTP 4xx:**
- MUST NOT retry (client error, not transient)
- MUST log error response
- MUST alert integration operations team
- MUST quarantine request for investigation

---

### Partial Batch Failure

**Batch operation partially succeeds:**
- MUST rollback entire batch (no partial success)
- MUST return error for entire batch
- MUST log which records failed validation
- MUST require client to resubmit entire batch after fixing errors

**NEVER:**
- Process partial batch
- Create inconsistent state with partial records
- Silently skip failed records
- Automatically retry failed records separately

---

## 5. RATE, RETRY & DAMAGE LIMITS

### Rate Limits (Per External System)

**Under NORMAL:**
- 1,000 requests per minute
- 10,000 requests per hour
- 100,000 requests per day
- 50 concurrent requests

**Under SUPERVISED_AUTONOMY:**
- 500 requests per minute
- 5,000 requests per hour
- 50,000 requests per day
- 25 concurrent requests

**Under MANUAL_ONLY:**
- 100 requests per minute (read-only operations only)
- 1,000 requests per hour
- 10,000 requests per day
- 10 concurrent requests

**Under KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE:**
- 10 requests per minute (health checks and audit exports only)
- 100 requests per hour
- 1,000 requests per day
- 5 concurrent requests

**Rate limit exceeded:**
- Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Include Retry-After header with seconds to wait
- Log rate limit violation
- Trigger alert after repeated violations (>10 per hour)

---

### Retry Limits and Backoff

**Maximum retry attempts:**
- Transient errors (5xx, timeout): 5 attempts
- Rate limits (429): 3 attempts
- Authentication failures (401): 0 attempts (manual intervention required)
- Authorization failures (403): 0 attempts (manual intervention required)
- Client errors (4xx except 429): 0 attempts (fix required before retry)

**Exponential backoff:**
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: 1 second delay
- Attempt 3: 2 seconds delay
- Attempt 4: 4 seconds delay
- Attempt 5: 8 seconds delay
- Attempt 6: 16 seconds delay (if applicable)

**Jitter:**
- Add random jitter (0-1000ms) to backoff delays
- Prevents thundering herd on external systems

**Retry prohibition:**
- NEVER retry non-idempotent operations without idempotency key
- NEVER retry financial transaction creation (risk of duplicate posting)
- NEVER retry payroll execution requests
- NEVER retry operations during KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE
- NEVER retry indefinitely (respect maximum attempt limit)

---

### Damage Limits (Per External System)

**Per-Request Limits:**
- Maximum 100 records per batch request
- Maximum 1 MB payload size
- Maximum 10 MB payload size for bulk operations (with approval)
- Maximum 10 seconds processing time

**Per-Minute Limits:**
- Maximum 1,000 records created
- Maximum 1,000 records updated
- Maximum 100 orders created
- Maximum 10 high-value operations (>$10,000 impact)

**Per-Hour Limits:**
- Maximum 10,000 records created
- Maximum 10,000 records updated
- Maximum 1,000 orders created
- Maximum 100 high-value operations

**Limit exceeded:**
- Reject request with HTTP 429
- Log limit violation
- Trigger security review (potential abuse)
- Temporary integration suspension after repeated violations

---

### Cascading Failure Prevention

**Circuit breaker implementation:**
- Open circuit after 10 consecutive failures
- Half-open circuit after 60-second cooldown
- Test request during half-open state
- Close circuit if test succeeds
- Reopen circuit if test fails

**Failure isolation:**
- Failure in System A does NOT block System B integrations
- Failure in inbound processing does NOT block outbound processing
- Failure in integration gateway does NOT cascade to internal services

**Graceful degradation:**
- Integration failures do NOT block internal operations
- Internal operations continue with integration queuing
- Manual fallback available for critical integrations

---

## 6. BYPASS PREVENTION

### Control State Validation Enforcement

**Integration Gateway MUST:**
- Validate control state before EVERY inbound request processing
- Validate control state before EVERY outbound request transmission
- Re-validate control state for queued requests at dequeue time
- NOT cache control state beyond 5-second TTL
- NOT implement bypass flags or configuration
- NOT implement emergency override mode

**Integration Gateway MUST NOT:**
- Assume previous validation result still valid
- Skip validation for trusted external systems
- Skip validation for internal integrations
- Skip validation during off-hours
- Skip validation for small payloads
- Skip validation for read-only operations (except health checks)

---

### Webhook Autonomous Execution Prevention

**Webhook handlers MUST NOT:**
- Execute financial operations without approval context

- Respect current domain authority rules
- Generate audit trail indicating replay
- Require authorization for bulk replays (>100 records)

**Manual replays MUST NOT:**
- Bypass control state validation
- Skip idempotency checks (risk of duplicates)
- Use stale approval tokens
- Execute during KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE without executive authorization

---

### Integration Configuration Protection

**Integration configuration MUST:**
- Be version controlled
- Require code review for changes
- Require change control approval for production
- Prevent runtime modification without audit trail
- NOT contain bypass flags
- NOT contain emergency override mechanisms

**Prohibited configuration patterns:**
- SKIP_CONTROL_CHECK: true
- BYPASS_VALIDATION: true
- EMERGENCY_MODE: enabled
- DEBUG_ALLOW_ALL: true
- DISABLE_RATE_LIMITS: true
- ALLOW_DUPLICATE_KEYS: true

---

### Integration Credential Protection

**Integration credentials MUST:**
- Be stored in secrets management system (not configuration files)
- Be rotated every 90 days
- Be unique per external system (no shared credentials)
- Include scope restrictions (read-only vs read-write)
- Be revocable immediately
- Include expiration timestamps

**Credential compromise response:**
- Immediate credential revocation
- Security incident investigation
- External system notification
- Audit trail review for unauthorized operations
- New credential generation with different key material

## ENFORCEMENT PRINCIPLES

### Defense-in-Depth Integration Architecture

**Layer 1: Network/Firewall:**
- IP whitelist enforcement
- TLS 1.3 minimum
- Certificate validation

**Layer 2: Authentication:**
- Token validation
- Scope verification
- Expiration check

**Layer 3: Integration Gateway (this specification):**
- Control state validation
- Domain authority validation
- Rate limiting
- Payload validation
- Idempotency enforcement

**Layer 4: Service Layer:**
- Business rule validation
- Approval requirement enforcement
- Cross-domain consistency

**Layer 5: Database Layer:**
- Trigger enforcement
- Constraint validation
- Audit trail generation

---

### External System Trust Model

**Integration Gateway assumes:**
- External systems are potentially compromised
- External systems may send malicious payloads
- External systems may replay old requests
- External systems may send inconsistent data
- External systems may attempt to overwrite internal truth
- External systems may attempt rate limit abuse
- External systems may attempt to bypass controls

**Integration Gateway NEVER assumes:**
- External systems validate their own data
- External systems respect rate limits
- External systems implement idempotency
- External systems handle errors gracefully
- External systems provide accurate timestamps
- External systems are secure

---

### Non-Negotiable Integration Rules

1. External systems NEVER overwrite Finance/HR/System domain data
2. Inbound writes NEVER execute during KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE without authorization
3. Control state validation NEVER skipped for external requests
4. Webhooks NEVER trigger autonomous financial or payroll operations
5. Integration failures NEVER cascade to internal operations
6. Retry attempts NEVER exceed maximum limits
7. Non-idempotent operations NEVER retried without idempotency key
8. Rate limits NEVER disabled in production
9. Authentication failures NEVER result in request acceptance
10. Quarantined payloads NEVER processed without manual review during restrictive states

---

**END OF SPECIFICATION**

---

**Certification Statement:**

This specification defines non-bypassable Integration Gateway control enforcement. Implementation is mandatory before external integration activation. Integration Gateway, webhook handlers, and outbound sync infrastructure MUST enforce these rules. Quarterly adversarial testing SHALL validate enforcement including webhook replay attacks, authentication bypass attempts, and rate limit circumvention.
