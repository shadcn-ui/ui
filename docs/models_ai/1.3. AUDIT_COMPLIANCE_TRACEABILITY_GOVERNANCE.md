# PHASE 1.3: AUDIT, COMPLIANCE & TRACEABILITY GOVERNANCE

**Document Classification:** Internal Policy — Binding  
**Effective Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Authority:** CTO, CFO, Chief Audit Architect  
**Audience:** CFO, COO, CTO, External Auditors, Risk & Compliance Officers, Board Audit Committee  
**Related Policies:** Phase 1.1 Governance Framework, Phase 1.2 Workflow Engine Governance

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the **non-negotiable audit, compliance, and traceability requirements** for Ocean ERP as an enterprise operating platform. It establishes audit as a **system of truth reconstruction**, not a logging utility.

**Audit exists to:**
- Protect executives from legal and financial exposure
- Prove decision accountability under scrutiny
- Enable forensic reconstruction of business events
- Survive regulatory, financial, and tax audits

**Core Principle:**  
If an action cannot be reconstructed with certainty, it is non-compliant and must be treated as invalid.

This document is not aspirational. It is **enforceable policy**. Compliance is mandatory. Non-compliance is grounds for system rejection.

---

## 1. AUDIT PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1 Definition of Audit

Audit is a **system of truth reconstruction** that operates independently from business logic. It is:

- **Immutable after capture:** Once recorded, audit events cannot be edited or deleted.
- **Comprehensive by default:** All material business actions generate audit events.
- **Independent from execution:** Audit recording is decoupled from business operations to prevent audit suppression.
- **Truth-preserving:** Audit data represents actual system state at the moment of capture, not interpreted summaries.

### 1.2 Audit as Legal Protection

Audit protects the enterprise from:

- **Regulatory penalties** resulting from inability to prove compliance
- **Fraud losses** that cannot be traced or reconstructed
- **Tax disputes** where transactions lack supporting evidence
- **Litigation exposure** where decisions cannot be justified
- **Executive liability** for actions without documented authority

### 1.3 The Reconstruction Principle

Every business action must be **reconstructable** to answer:

1. **Who** performed or authorized the action?
2. **When** did it occur (immutable timestamp)?
3. **What** was the before-state and after-state?
4. **Why** was it performed (business justification)?
5. **How** was it authorized (governance alignment)?
6. **What authority** did the actor possess at that moment?

Failure to answer any of these questions renders the action **audit-deficient**.

### 1.4 The Primary Rule

**If it changes money, inventory, people, or authority — it is auditable.**

No exceptions. No exemptions. No "internal-only" actions.

---

## 2. AUDIT SCOPE DEFINITION

### 2.1 Auditable Event Categories

The following categories of actions are **mandatory audit events**. No module, workflow, or integration may bypass audit requirements for these categories.

#### Financial Events

- Journal entry creation, modification, posting
- Payment processing (AP, AR, payroll)
- Invoice creation, approval, cancellation
- Credit/debit note issuance
- Write-offs, bad debt provisions
- Foreign exchange revaluation
- Period close and lock operations
- Budget allocations and adjustments
- Bank reconciliation actions

#### Inventory & Supply Chain Events

- Stock receipt and putaway
- Stock issuance and picking
- Stock adjustments (physical count corrections)
- Inter-warehouse transfers
- Inventory write-offs and scrap
- Goods return processing
- Lot/serial number assignments
- Valuation method changes

#### Governance & Approval Events

- Approval granted or denied

- Escalation trigger and resolution
- Delegation of authority
- Workflow timeout actions
- Manual intervention in automated processes
- Emergency access grants

#### Master Data Events

- Customer credit limit changes

- Employee salary adjustments
- Role and permission assignments

#### HR & Payroll Events

- Employee hiring, termination, suspension
- Salary and benefit changes
- Payroll run execution
- Payroll correction and reversal
- Leave accrual and consumption
- Performance rating assignment
- Disciplinary action recording

#### Integration Events

- External system data ingestion
- Data transformation and mapping decisions
- Synchronization success and failure
- Deduplication logic execution
- Reconciliation discrepancy detection
- Retry attempts and outcomes

#### Security & Access Events

- User authentication success and failure
- Role assignment and revocation
- Permission grants and denials
- Session initiation and termination
- Password resets and credential changes
- Multi-factor authentication events
- API key generation and revocation

### 2.2 Non-Exemption Rule

**No event category may opt out of audit requirements** under any circumstance, including:

- Performance optimization
- Development or testing environments (audit must be testable)
- Internal-only operations
- Low-value transactions
- Automated bulk operations

Volume is not a valid reason for audit exemption.

---

## 3. AUDIT EVENT STRUCTURE (CONCEPTUAL)

### 3.1 Mandatory Audit Attributes

Every audit event must capture the following attributes at the moment of action. **Absence of any attribute constitutes audit failure.**

| Attribute | Definition | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Actor** | User, service account, or system identifier that initiated the action | Must be resolvable to a human or system authority |
| **Authority Role** | The role or permission set the actor possessed at action time | Must align with Phase 1.1 authority matrix |
| **Action Type** | The specific operation performed (create, update, delete, approve, override, etc.) | Must be enumerated, not free-text |
| **Target Entity** | The business object affected (invoice #12345, product SKU-ABC, employee ID 789) | Must be uniquely identifiable |
| **Before State** | The complete state of the entity prior to action | Must be machine-readable, not summarized |
| **After State** | The complete state of the entity after action | Must be machine-readable, not summarized |
| **Timestamp** | Immutable server timestamp (UTC, synchronized) | Must not be user-provided or client-generated |
| **Source** | Origin of action (manual entry, workflow execution, integration sync, scheduled job) | Must distinguish human vs. automated actions |
| **Justification** | Business reason or approval reference | Required for high-materiality actions |
| **Approval References** | Links to approval records, if action required pre-approval | Must be traceable to Phase 1.2 workflow records |

### 3.2 Attribute Integrity

- **Before State and After State** must be captured atomically with the action. Post-hoc reconstruction is prohibited.
- **Timestamps** must originate from a synchronized server clock. Client-provided timestamps are invalid.
- **Actor identity** must be authenticated and verified. Anonymous or "system" actors without traceability are prohibited.

### 3.3 Audit Event Completeness

An audit event is **complete** only when all mandatory attributes are captured and persisted. Incomplete events must:

1. Trigger system-level alerts to audit administrators
2. Block downstream dependent actions
3. Be surfaced to executive visibility (Phase 1.4 dashboard)

Incomplete audit is equivalent to no audit.

---

## 4. IMMUTABILITY RULES

### 4.1 Definition of Immutable Data

Once created and persisted, the following data types become **immutable** and cannot be edited or deleted:

- **Posted journal entries** in the general ledger
- **Stock movement ledger entries** (receipts, issues, adjustments)
- **Approved and executed payroll runs**
- **Closed accounting periods** (month-end, quarter-end, year-end)
- **Completed workflows with approval or override actions**
- **Signed documents** (contracts, invoices, purchase orders)
- **Audit log entries themselves**

### 4.2 Immutability Enforcement

The system must:

- **Reject edit or delete operations** on immutable records at the application and database layers
- **Log all attempted violations** as high-severity security events
- **Surface violations** to executive visibility immediately
- **Preserve original data** even when corrections are required

### 4.3 Correction Mechanism

Errors in immutable data must be corrected using **reversal + new record**:

1. **Reversal Record:** A new audit event that negates the original action (e.g., reversing journal entry)
2. **Correction Record:** A new audit event that records the correct action
3. **Linkage:** Both records must reference the original event and each other

**Prohibited actions:**
- Editing the original record
- Deleting the original record
- Suppressing the original record from audit queries

### 4.4 Immutability Exception Process

If a legitimate need arises to modify immutable data (e.g., legal order, fraud investigation), the following process applies:

1. **Executive Authorization:** CFO or COO approval required
2. **Audit Annotation:** Reason for modification logged as a separate audit event
3. **Regulatory Notification:** If applicable, notify tax or regulatory authorities
4. **Forensic Preservation:** Original data preserved in forensic archive

Immutability exceptions are themselves auditable events.

---

## 5. TRACEABILITY CHAIN REQUIREMENT

### 5.1 Definition of Trace Chain

A **trace chain** is an unbroken sequence of audit events connecting a business trigger to its ultimate financial, inventory, or operational outcome.

Every material business outcome must be **traceable backward** to its originating event and **traceable forward** to its downstream impacts.

### 5.2 Mandatory Trace Chains

The following trace chains are **mandatory** and must be reconstructable on demand:

| Trace Chain | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Order → Inventory → Accounting** | Sales order → inventory depletion → COGS journal entry → revenue recognition |
| **Purchase → Receipt → Inventory → Payables** | Purchase order → goods receipt → inventory increase → accounts payable accrual |
| **Work Order → Material Consumption → Production** | Manufacturing work order → raw material issue → finished goods receipt → inventory valuation |
| **Approval → Decision → Execution** | Approval request → decision recorded → action executed → outcome verified |
| **External Event → Mapping → Outcome** | E-commerce order sync → internal sales order creation → fulfillment → revenue recognition |
| **Payroll Calculation → Approval → Payment** | Payroll run → management approval → bank transfer → GL posting |
| **Budget Allocation → Commitment → Expenditure** | Budget line approved → purchase order committed → goods received → invoice posted |

### 5.3 Trace Chain Integrity

A trace chain is **broken** if:

- Any intermediate event is missing
- Links between events are ambiguous or non-unique
- Timestamps are non-sequential
- Actor authority is inconsistent with action type

Broken trace chains must be flagged as **audit exceptions** and cannot contribute to KPI calculations or financial reporting.

### 5.4 KPI Traceability Requirement

Every KPI, metric, or dashboard value presented to executives must be **traceable to raw audit events**. Aggregated metrics without trace chains are prohibited from executive dashboards.

If a KPI cannot be drilled down to its constituent audit events, it must be marked as **unverified** and excluded from decision-making.

---

## 6. WORKFLOW & AUDIT INTEGRATION

### 6.1 Workflow as Audit Source

Workflow executions (Phase 1.2) are **first-class audit events**. Every workflow action generates mandatory audit records including:

- Workflow instance initiation
- Approval step entry and exit
- Approval decision (grant/deny) with actor and timestamp
- Override execution with justification
- Escalation trigger and resolution
- Workflow completion or failure

### 6.2 Approval Without Audit Trace is Invalid

An approval decision that is not captured as an audit event is **invalid** and must not result in execution.

The system must:

- **Block execution** if approval audit capture fails
- **Retry audit persistence** before proceeding
- **Escalate to manual review** if audit write failure persists

Workflow convenience must never override audit integrity.

### 6.3 Override as High-Severity Audit Event

Overrides (Phase 1.2) are elevated-severity audit events requiring:

- **Explicit justification** captured as mandatory text field (not optional)
- **Executive notification** within the same business day
- **Audit log annotation** marking the event as override, not normal workflow
- **Trace preservation** of the override reason for compliance inquiries

Override frequency is a key audit risk metric and must be surfaced to executive visibility.

### 6.4 Workflow Silence as Audit Exception

If a workflow completes without generating expected audit events, the system must:

1. Treat the workflow as **failed**
2. Prevent downstream actions from proceeding
3. Alert audit administrators
4. Require manual audit reconciliation before resolution

Workflow silence indicates either:
- Audit mechanism failure
- Unauthorized bypass attempt

Both scenarios require immediate investigation.

---

## 7. INTEGRATION AUDIT & RECONCILIATION

### 7.1 External Systems are Untrusted

All external systems (e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, banks, tax authorities) are treated as **untrusted data sources**. Their data is not assumed to be correct, complete, or synchronized.

### 7.2 Inbound Data Logging

Before any external data mutates internal system state, the system must:

1. **Log the raw inbound payload** in its original format (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.)
2. **Capture integration metadata** (source system, timestamp, API version, authentication context)
3. **Assign a unique integration event ID** for traceability
4. **Record data before transformation** to preserve original state

### 7.3 Deduplication Decisions are Audited

When the system determines that an inbound event is a duplicate and should not create a new internal record, the **deduplication decision** must be logged as an audit event including:

- The inbound event identifier
- The existing internal record identifier
- The matching logic used (exact match, fuzzy match, business rule)
- The outcome (reject duplicate, merge data, flag for review)

Deduplication is not a silent operation. It is a business decision with audit implications.

### 7.4 Sync Failures Retained Permanently

Integration failures (API errors, timeouts, authentication failures, data validation errors) must be:

- **Retained indefinitely** within the audit retention window
- **Linked to retry attempts** if retry logic is invoked
- **Surfaced to operations teams** for investigation
- **Included in reconciliation reports** as unresolved discrepancies

Failed integrations are not "cleaned up" automatically. They are compliance artifacts.

### 7.5 Reconciliation Discrepancies

When reconciliation (e.g., bank statement vs. internal cash ledger, marketplace order count vs. internal order count) reveals discrepancies, the system must:

- **Flag the discrepancy** as an audit event
- **Preserve both datasets** (external and internal) without auto-correction
- **Require human review** to determine root cause
- **Log the resolution decision** (adjust internal, dispute external, classify as expected variance)

Auto-correction without audit trail is prohibited. Discrepancies are investigated, not concealed.

### 7.6 Integration Logs as Compliance Artifacts

Integration logs are **compliance artifacts**, not operational logs. They must:

- Be **immutable** once written
- Be **exportable** for auditor review
- Be **retained** per regulatory requirements (minimum 2 years)
- Be **cross-referenced** with financial and inventory audit trails

Integration logs may be subpoenaed in disputes or audits. Treat them accordingly.

---

## 8. TIME-BASED COMPLIANCE

### 8.1 Data Retention Policy

Audit data must be retained per regulatory and legal requirements. Minimum retention periods:

| Data Category | Retention Period | Justification |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Financial & Tax Data** | ≥ 7 years | Indonesian tax law, financial audit requirements |
| **Payroll & HR Data** | ≥ 7 years or per labor law | Employment law, social security compliance |
| **Audit Logs (All Categories)** | ≥ 7 years | Financial audit, fraud investigation, litigation |
| **Integration Logs** | ≥ 2 years | Reconciliation, dispute resolution |
| **Security & Access Logs** | ≥ 1 year | Security incident investigation, compliance audit |
| **Immutable Records** | Permanent (no deletion) | General ledger, stock ledger, payroll archives |

### 8.2 Retention Enforcement

The system must:

- **Block hard delete operations** on data within the retention window
- **Automate retention policy enforcement** without manual intervention
- **Archive data nearing end-of-retention** to cold storage (still accessible for audit)
- **Require executive authorization** for any retention policy changes

### 8.3 Prohibition on Premature Deletion

Deleting audit data before the retention period expires is **prohibited** under all circumstances, including:

- System storage constraints
- Performance optimization
- Data anonymization requests (GDPR-style)
- Vendor migration or platform changes

If storage limits are reached, expand storage. Audit data is non-negotiable.

### 8.4 Retention Compliance Reporting

The system must produce quarterly reports for audit administrators confirming:

- All audit data categories meet minimum retention requirements
- No unauthorized deletions occurred
- Archive integrity is verified (checksums, backup validation)
- Cold storage is accessible and restorable

Retention violations must be escalated to CFO and CTO immediately.

---

## 9. AUDIT FAILURE MODES

### 9.1 Definition of Audit Failure

An **audit failure** occurs when the system cannot capture, persist, or retrieve a required audit event. This includes:

- Audit log write failure (database unavailable, storage full)
- Audit attribute missing or incomplete
- Timestamp synchronization failure
- Audit retrieval returning inconsistent data

### 9.2 System Behavior During Audit Failure

When an audit failure is detected, the system **must**:

1. **Block the operation** that generated the audit event
2. **Prevent downstream actions** that depend on the failed audit
3. **Surface exception** to executive visibility immediately
4. **Preserve system integrity** over operational convenience
5. **Log the failure itself** as a meta-audit event (if possible)

### 9.3 Prohibited Behaviors

The system **must not**:

- Proceed with the business operation and "retry audit later"
- Queue audit events for asynchronous persistence
- Downgrade audit severity to "warning" and continue
- Allow users to bypass audit with "emergency mode"

**Audit failure is system failure.** Business operations halt until audit is restored.

### 9.4 Audit Failure Recovery

Recovery from audit failure requires:

1. **Root cause diagnosis** (storage, network, database corruption, etc.)
2. **Audit mechanism restoration** verified by test writes
3. **Backfill of missed events** from application logs, if possible
4. **CFO/CTO sign-off** on recovery completeness
5. **Post-mortem documentation** to prevent recurrence

Operations may resume only after audit capability is fully restored and verified.

### 9.5 Immutability Violation Response

If an attempt is made to edit or delete immutable data, the system must:

1. **Reject the operation** at all layers (UI, API, database)
2. **Log the attempt** as a high-severity security event
3. **Identify the actor** and escalate to security/audit team
4. **Alert executives** within the same business day
5. **Investigate intent** (accidental vs. malicious)

Immutability violations are treated as potential fraud indicators.

### 9.6 Trace Chain Break Response

If a trace chain is detected as broken (missing intermediate event, inconsistent data), the system must:

1. **Flag the chain as incomplete** and exclude from reporting
2. **Prevent KPI calculation** that depends on the broken chain
3. **Surface the break** to audit administrators for investigation
4. **Require manual reconciliation** before the chain is marked as resolved

Broken trace chains indicate data integrity issues and must not be ignored.

---

## 10. EXECUTIVE & AUDITOR ACCESS

### 10.1 Read-Only Audit Access

External auditors and internal audit teams must have **read-only access** to all audit data, including:

- Complete audit event history
- Integration logs
- Workflow execution traces
- Security and access logs
- Immutable record archives

Access is read-only. Auditors do not modify audit data.

### 10.2 Exportability Requirement

All audit data must be **exportable in auditor-standard formats** without data mutation, including:

- **CSV** for tabular data analysis
- **PDF** for human-readable reports with chain-of-custody
- **JSON** for structured data interchange
- **ISO 8601 timestamps** and UTC timezone for all exports

Exports must be **byte-for-byte identical** to the internal data. No summarization, rounding, or filtering is permitted during export.

### 10.3 No Hidden Audit Data

There must be **no "internal-only" or "system-only" audit data** that is hidden from auditors. If an event is audited, it is auditable by authorized reviewers.

Prohibited practices:
- Separate "debug logs" that capture business decisions but are not surfaced as audit events
- "Soft delete" flags that hide data from audit queries
- Access controls that prevent auditors from viewing specific audit categories

What the system audits must equal what auditors can review.

### 10.4 Audit Query Transparency

Auditors must be able to:

- **Query audit data** using standard filters (date range, actor, action type, entity)
- **Trace chains end-to-end** without custom tooling
- **Reconstruct events** in chronological order
- **Verify immutability** by confirming no edit timestamps exist

The audit system must be **self-documenting**. Auditors should not require engineering support to perform standard audit queries.

### 10.5 Audit Data Integrity Verification

The system must provide mechanisms for auditors to verify audit data integrity, including:

- **Checksums or hashes** for archived audit data
- **Sequential audit event numbering** to detect missing events
- **Timestamp monotonicity checks** to detect backdating
- **Actor-authority cross-checks** against Phase 1.1 authority matrix

Auditors must be able to independently verify that audit data has not been tampered with.

---

## 11. COMPLIANCE ALIGNMENT

### 11.1 Regulatory Framework Alignment

This audit governance framework is designed to align with:

| Framework | Alignment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **PSAK (Indonesian GAAP)** | Financial statement traceability, supporting documentation requirements |
| **Indonesian Tax Law** | Transaction retention, invoice validity, transfer pricing documentation |
| **Labor Law (UU Ketenagakerjaan)** | Payroll records, termination documentation, benefit calculations |
| **Internal Control Principles (SOX-like)** | Segregation of duties, authorization trails, change logging |
| **Data Privacy (if applicable)** | Audit logs for data access, modification, deletion; subject rights tracking |

**Important:** This document does not claim certification or compliance attestation. It states **alignment of design principles** with regulatory expectations. Actual compliance requires legal review and auditor validation.

### 11.2 Segregation of Duties (SoD)

Audit mechanisms support segregation of duties by:

- Recording **who performed** each action and **who approved** it
- Detecting **SoD violations** (e.g., same person creates and approves a payment)
- Surfacing violations to audit administrators
- Requiring compensating controls (additional approval, executive review) when SoD is violated

SoD violations are not automatically blocked but are **flagged as elevated-risk audit events**.

### 11.3 Least Privilege Access

Audit supports least privilege by:

- Recording **authority role at action time** (not just actor identity)
- Enabling **post-hoc access reviews** to detect privilege creep
- Flagging **actions performed with excessive privilege** (e.g., admin role used for routine task)
- Supporting **time-limited privilege grants** with audit trails

Privilege escalation without audit trail is prohibited.

### 11.4 Period Close Discipline

Audit enforces period close discipline by:

- Making **closed periods immutable**
- Requiring **executive authorization** to reopen periods (with audit trail)
- Logging **all attempts to post to closed periods** as violations
- Surfacing **period close exceptions** to CFO visibility

Period close integrity is foundational to financial audit credibility.

### 11.5 Compliance Reporting

The system must produce standard compliance reports for auditors, including:

- **Transaction detail reports** (sales, purchases, payments) with supporting audit trails
- **Change logs** for master data (pricing, credit limits, bank accounts)
- **Exception reports** (overrides, escalations, SoD violations)
- **Reconciliation reports** (bank, inventory, payroll)
- **User access reports** (role assignments, permission grants, authentication failures)

These reports must be **auditor-ready** without additional data transformation.

---

## 12. GOVERNANCE DEPENDENCIES

### 12.1 Relationship to Phase 1.1

**Phase 1.1 Governance Framework** defines **WHO can decide**. Phase 1.3 records **WHAT was decided**.

Dependencies:

- Audit captures **authority role** as defined in Phase 1.1 authority matrix
- Approval thresholds in Phase 1.1 determine which actions require justification
- Materiality definitions in Phase 1.1 determine audit severity levels

Phase 1.3 cannot operate independently. It consumes authority definitions from Phase 1.1.

### 12.2 Relationship to Phase 1.2

**Phase 1.2 Workflow Engine Governance** defines **HOW decisions are executed**. Phase 1.3 records **THAT execution occurred**.

Dependencies:

- Workflow approvals generate audit events
- Workflow overrides are elevated-severity audit events
- Workflow timeouts and escalations are traceable via audit
- Workflow silence (missing audit events) is a failure mode

Phase 1.3 enforces that workflows cannot bypass audit.

### 12.3 Relationship to Phase 1.4

**Phase 1.4 Executive Dashboard & Intelligence** consumes audit data as its **source of truth**.

Dependencies:

- All KPIs presented in executive dashboards are traceable to audit events
- Exception metrics (overrides, escalations, SoD violations) flow from audit
- Compliance health indicators (period close status, audit failures) are audit-derived
- Forensic drill-down from dashboard metrics to audit events is mandatory

**No audit = no dashboard trust.**

If audit is incomplete, dashboard metrics must be flagged as unreliable.

### 12.4 Audit as System Foundation

Audit is not a feature. It is the **foundation of system credibility**.

| Without Audit | With Audit |
|---------------|------------|
| Operations are unverifiable | Operations are reconstructable |
| Disputes escalate to litigation | Disputes are resolved with evidence |
| Executives lack decision confidence | Executives have forensic visibility |
| Auditors reject financials | Auditors validate financials |
| Compliance is aspirational | Compliance is provable |

Audit transforms the ERP from an operational tool into a **legal and financial system of record**.

---

## ENFORCEMENT & ACCOUNTABILITY

### Non-Compliance Consequences

Failure to comply with this audit governance framework results in:

1. **System rejection** by CFO/COO/CTO
2. **Audit qualification** (auditors issue modified opinion)
3. **Regulatory penalties** for inadequate recordkeeping
4. **Executive liability** for decisions without supporting evidence
5. **Loss of customer trust** in system credibility

### Audit Governance Review Cycle

This document is reviewed **annually** by:

- CFO (financial audit perspective)
- CTO (technical implementation feasibility)
- Chief Audit Architect or equivalent
- External auditors (advisory input)

Updates require CFO and CTO joint approval.

### Audit Metrics

The following metrics are tracked and reported to executive leadership **monthly**:

- Audit event volume by category
- Audit failure count and resolution time
- Immutability violation attempts
- Trace chain break count
- Override frequency by actor and action type
- Integration sync failure rate
- Audit data retention compliance status

Metrics indicate audit health and system integrity.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Audit is not overhead. Audit is **protection**.

It protects executives from liability, protects the business from fraud, protects financials from qualification, and protects decisions from ambiguity.

An enterprise resource planning system that cannot prove what happened, when it happened, and who authorized it is not an asset.

**An ERP without audit integrity is a liability, not a system.**
