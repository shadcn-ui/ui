# FAILURE DRILLS & EXECUTIVE SIGN-OFF REQUIREMENTS

## SECTION 1 — FAILURE DRILLS

- **Control_state store outage**: disconnect authoritative control_state service; verify all layers assume MANUAL_ONLY or KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE.
- **Audit subsystem outage**: disable audit logging; verify ALL write operations blocked system-wide immediately.
- **Partial DB availability**: simulate primary DB down, replica available; verify writes blocked, reads allowed on replica only.
- **Integration gateway partition**: disconnect integration gateway from control_state service; verify all external writes quarantined.
- **Cache inconsistency**: force stale cache (>5s TTL); verify enforcement layers re-fetch or fail-closed.
- **Concurrent kill-switch activations**: simulate multiple executives activating simultaneously; verify first valid activation accepted, subsequent logged.

## SECTION 2 — EXPECTED SYSTEM BEHAVIOR

- **Control_state store outage**: writes BLOCKED; API Gateway enforces first; reads allowed; escalation to CTO+CRO within 5 minutes.
- **Audit subsystem outage**: ALL writes BLOCKED; Service Layer + Database enforce; reads allowed; immediate CTO+CRO+CEO notification.
- **Partial DB availability**: writes BLOCKED; Database layer enforces; reads allowed on replica; escalation to CTO+DBA.
- **Integration gateway partition**: external writes QUARANTINED; Integration Boundary enforces; internal operations continue per control_state; escalation to CTO.
- **Cache inconsistency**: writes BLOCKED if stale >5s; each enforcement layer re-fetches or assumes fail-closed; reads allowed; no escalation if auto-recovery successful.
- **Concurrent kill-switch activations**: all writes BLOCKED; first activation wins; all layers enforce freeze; escalation to CEO+CRO with activation log.

## SECTION 3 — EXECUTIVE SIGN-OFF

- **Who must sign**: CTO, CRO, CFO (for financial domain), CEO (for production release).
- **Evidence reviewed**: failure drill execution logs; blocked write counts; zero-write confirmation; audit trail completeness; escalation notification proof.
- **Demonstrated live**: kill-switch activation <5s; write freeze across all layers verified; reactivation requires multi-party approval; audit logging operational.
- **Blocks production release**: any drill failure; >0 writes during kill-switch active; missing audit logs; reactivation without multi-party approval; cache TTL >5s.

## SECTION 4 — RELEASE GATE

- **Pass conditions**: all 6 drills pass; zero writes during kill-switch active; audit logs complete and immutable; fail-closed confirmed on all dependency failures; executive sign-off documented.
- **Fail conditions**: any drill shows writes allowed when blocked; audit logging failure does not block writes; cache inconsistency allows stale decisions; single-party reactivation succeeds.
- **Automatic rollback triggers**: post-deployment write during kill-switch active; audit logging failure in production; control_state unavailable >5 minutes without fail-closed enforcement.
