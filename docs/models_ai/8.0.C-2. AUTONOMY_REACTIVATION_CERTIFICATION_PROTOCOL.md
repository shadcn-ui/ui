# AUTONOMY REACTIVATION & CERTIFICATION PROTOCOL

**Document Classification**: Enterprise Risk & Governance Policy  
**Effective Date**: January 5, 2026  
**Authority**: Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer  
**Related Policies**: Phase 8.C-1A (Kill-Switch Formal Definition), Phase 8.C-1B (Activation Scenarios)  
**Review Cycle**: Annual or upon material reactivation incident  
**Regulatory Classification**: Material Control Policy — Subject to External Audit

---

## I. PRINCIPLE OF REACTIVATION

### Governing Philosophy

Reactivation of suspended autonomous processes is a privilege, not a right. Once the Autonomy Kill-Switch has been activated pursuant to Phase 8.C-1B, the default operational state is manual processing under heightened oversight. This state persists until the organization affirmatively demonstrates—through documented evidence, independent verification, and multi-party certification—that autonomous operation may safely resume.

### Subordination of Speed to Certainty

The duration of process suspension is irrelevant to reactivation decisions. Operational pressure, customer commitments, business urgency, competitive disadvantage, and revenue impact are explicitly excluded as considerations in reactivation determination. The sole criterion for reactivation is control certainty. If certainty cannot be established, suspension continues indefinitely.

### Burden of Proof

The burden of proof rests exclusively with the process owner seeking reactivation. The organization does not bear any obligation to expedite reactivation, accommodate operational timelines, or justify continued suspension. Process owners must affirmatively prove that reactivation is safe, controlled, and auditable. Absence of evidence equals continued suspension.

### Precautionary Principle

When evidence is incomplete, when root cause analysis is inconclusive, when corrective measures cannot be independently validated, or when reasonable doubt exists regarding control adequacy, the decision defaults to continued suspension. Uncertainty is resolved in favor of control preservation, not operational convenience.

### Accountability Standard

Individuals who certify reactivation readiness assume personal accountability for the accuracy and completeness of their certification. If a reactivated process subsequently fails or produces incorrect outcomes, the certifying parties may be required to explain their basis for approval under audit, regulatory examination, or board inquiry. This accountability is not theoretical. Certification signatures represent professional attestations subject to scrutiny and consequence.

## II. REACTIVATION PRECONDITIONS

### Universal Requirement

All seven preconditions enumerated below must be satisfied before any reactivation may occur. These preconditions are non-negotiable, non-waiverable, and jointly necessary. Satisfaction of six preconditions while one remains unfulfilled is insufficient. Reactivation may not proceed until all seven conditions achieve documented compliance.

### Precondition 1: Root Cause Identified and Documented

**Requirement:**  
The specific cause of the Kill-Switch activation must be identified with precision sufficient to explain the incident to external auditors, regulatory examiners, and board oversight committees. Root cause documentation must identify the originating defect, configuration error, data anomaly, control gap, or external factor that precipitated the incident. Speculative explanations, probable causes, or working theories do not satisfy this precondition.

**Accountable Role:**  
Process Owner, Chief Information Officer, Chief Operating Officer (as applicable to domain).

**Verification Method:**  
Internal Audit Director reviews root cause analysis document and confirms that the explanation is specific, evidence-based, and reproducible. Auditor must be able to trace the causal chain from observed symptom to underlying defect without logical gaps.

**Pass Criteria:**  
Root cause document exists, identifies a single primary cause or clearly articulated combination of causes, and includes supporting evidence such as system logs, data samples, transaction traces, or environmental conditions. Document is signed by process owner and validated by Internal Audit Director.

**Failure Consequence:**  
If root cause cannot be established, reactivation is prohibited. The process remains suspended until investigative work produces definitive findings. Indefinite suspension is preferable to reactivating a process whose failure mechanism is not understood.

---

### Precondition 2: Control Failure Corrected at Source

**Requirement:**  
The specific control deficiency, system defect, configuration error, or data quality issue that caused or contributed to the incident must be corrected in the production environment. Corrective action must address the root cause directly, not merely the visible symptom. Workarounds, monitoring enhancements, or procedural compensations do not satisfy this precondition unless the underlying defect cannot be remediated, in which case risk acceptance per Section VI is required.

**Accountable Role:**  
Process Owner, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Officer, domain-specific executive.

**Verification Method:**  
Independent technical review confirms that the identified defect has been corrected. Verification includes code review, configuration validation, database constraint verification, or business rule inspection as appropriate to the defect type. Reviewer must be independent of the implementation team.

**Pass Criteria:**  
Documented evidence that the specific defect has been corrected. Evidence may include deployment records, configuration change logs, database schema modifications, or business rule updates. Correction must be validated in production environment, not solely in testing environments.

**Failure Consequence:**  
If the root cause control failure has not been corrected, reactivation is prohibited. Monitoring a known defect does not constitute correction. The organization may not knowingly operate defective processes regardless of mitigating procedures.

---

### Precondition 3: No Unresolved Data Inconsistencies

**Requirement:**  
All data discrepancies, balance variances, reconciliation failures, or cross-system inconsistencies that existed at the time of Kill-Switch activation must be resolved and corrected. The organization's records must reflect accurate reality. Unresolved discrepancies may not be carried forward into resumed autonomous operations. If discrepancies cannot be resolved with certainty, they must be written off or adjusted through formal management override with documented justification and board notification if material.

**Accountable Role:**  
Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Operations Director, Human Resources Director (as applicable to domain).

**Verification Method:**  
Reconciliation procedures confirm that all material balances agree between systems, subsidiary ledgers agree to control accounts, physical counts match system records, and external confirmations align with internal records. Internal Audit Director validates reconciliation completeness.

**Pass Criteria:**  
Signed reconciliation certification from domain executive confirming zero unresolved material discrepancies. Immaterial discrepancies below established thresholds may be accepted with documented justification. Material discrepancies require resolution or formal adjustment with audit trail.

**Failure Consequence:**  
If data inconsistencies remain unresolved, reactivation is prohibited. Autonomous processes operating on inaccurate data propagate inaccuracy across all subsequent transactions. Manual processing continues until data integrity is restored and certified.

---

### Precondition 4: No Conflicting Regulatory Inquiry or Examination

**Requirement:**  
The organization must not be subject to active regulatory inquiry, audit, examination, or investigation related to the domain in which reactivation is sought. If regulatory activity is ongoing, reactivation requires explicit written consent from the regulatory authority or formal conclusion of the inquiry. The organization may not resume autonomous operations in a domain under regulatory scrutiny without regulator awareness and non-objection.

**Accountable Role:**  
General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer.

**Verification Method:**  
Legal counsel confirms in writing that no active regulatory proceedings affect the domain in question, or that regulatory authorities have been notified of the proposed reactivation and have provided written consent or declined to object.

**Pass Criteria:**  
Documented confirmation from General Counsel that either no regulatory inquiry exists, or that the relevant regulatory authority has been notified and has not objected to reactivation. Regulatory consent or non-objection must be documented in writing.

**Failure Consequence:**  
If regulatory inquiry is active and consent has not been obtained, reactivation is prohibited. Resuming autonomous operations during regulatory examination without regulator awareness constitutes obstruction risk and demonstrates poor judgment. Manual operations continue until regulatory inquiry concludes or consent is obtained.

---

### Precondition 5: No Repeat Incident Pattern

**Requirement:**  
The incident triggering Kill-Switch activation must not represent a recurring pattern of failure in the same process or domain. If the same or substantially similar incident has occurred previously within the trailing twelve-month period, reactivation requires escalation to Board Audit Committee and may require independent third-party assessment of process design adequacy. Repeated failures indicate structural weakness, not isolated incidents.

**Accountable Role:**  
Chief Risk Officer, Internal Audit Director.

**Verification Method:**  
Review of incident history, kill-switch activation log, and risk register to determine whether prior incidents of similar nature exist. Pattern determination considers root cause similarity, not merely symptom similarity.

**Pass Criteria:**  
Documented confirmation that no substantially similar incident has occurred in the trailing twelve months, or if a pattern exists, that Board Audit Committee has reviewed the situation and authorized reactivation subject to structural remediation commitment.

**Failure Consequence:**  
If a repeat pattern is identified and Board Audit Committee has not reviewed and authorized reactivation, reactivation is prohibited. Repeated failures require architectural or process redesign, not repeated reactivation attempts. The organization must address structural weakness before resuming autonomous operation.

---

### Precondition 6: Manual Operations Proven Stable

**Requirement:**  
The organization must demonstrate that manual processing procedures implemented during autonomous suspension have operated without material error, control violation, or stakeholder impact for a minimum period appropriate to transaction volume and domain risk. High-risk domains such as financial accounting and payroll require minimum five business days of stable manual operations. Lower-risk domains require minimum three business days. This precondition ensures that resuming autonomy does not mask underlying process design deficiencies.

**Accountable Role:**  
Process Owner, domain-specific executive.

**Verification Method:**  
Review of manual transaction logs, error rates, approval compliance, and stakeholder feedback during manual operation period. Internal Audit Director validates that manual operations met control standards and produced accurate outcomes.

**Pass Criteria:**  
Documented evidence that manual operations proceeded without material error for the required minimum period. Evidence includes transaction logs, approval records, reconciliation certifications, and stakeholder confirmation of satisfactory service.

**Failure Consequence:**  
If manual operations have not achieved stable operation for the required minimum period, reactivation is prohibited. The organization must first demonstrate that the underlying business process functions correctly under manual control before adding autonomous execution complexity.

---

### Precondition 7: Audit Trail Completeness Confirmed

**Requirement:**  
The organization must confirm that all transactions executed during autonomous suspension, all investigative activities, all corrective actions, and all reactivation preparations have been documented in audit logs with complete attribution, timestamps, and justification. The audit trail must be sufficient to satisfy external auditor inquiries and regulatory examinations. No gaps, deletions, or unexplained modifications may exist in the audit trail covering the suspension period.

**Accountable Role:**  
Chief Information Officer, Internal Audit Director.

**Verification Method:**  
Audit trail review confirms chronological completeness, absence of gaps or deletions, proper user attribution for all actions, and retention of supporting documentation. Internal Audit Director certifies audit trail adequacy.

**Pass Criteria:**  
Signed certification from Internal Audit Director confirming that the audit trail covering the incident, suspension period, investigation, and remediation is complete, tamper-evident, and sufficient for external audit purposes.

**Failure Consequence:**  
If audit trail completeness cannot be confirmed, reactivation is prohibited. Incomplete audit trails constitute control failures independent of the original incident. The organization may not resume autonomous operations while operating with deficient audit infrastructure.

---

## III. CERTIFICATION ROLES & SIGN-OFF AUTHORITY

### Multi-Party Approval Requirement

Reactivation of suspended autonomous processes requires certification and approval from multiple independent parties. No individual possesses unilateral authority to reactivate suspended processes. This multi-party requirement ensures that reactivation decisions receive appropriate scrutiny and are not influenced by unbalanced consideration of operational pressure over control adequacy.

### Certification Role 1: Operational Owner Certification

**Role Holder:**  
The executive or senior manager with direct operational accountability for the affected business process. For financial processes, this is the Chief Financial Officer or Controller. For operational processes, this is the Chief Operating Officer or relevant Operations Director. For human resources processes, this is the Chief Human Resources Officer.

**Certification Statement Required:**  
"I certify that the process under my operational authority has satisfied all seven reactivation preconditions enumerated in Section II of this protocol. I have reviewed supporting evidence, consulted with process experts, and confirmed that manual operations demonstrate process correctness. I accept accountability for the accuracy of this certification and acknowledge that I may be required to defend this certification under audit or regulatory examination."

**Certification Basis:**  
Direct review of precondition evidence, consultation with process teams, validation of manual operation stability, and assessment of operational readiness.

---

### Certification Role 2: Risk & Compliance Certification

**Role Holder:**  
Chief Risk Officer or Chief Compliance Officer. This role must be independent of operational process ownership and must not report directly to the operational process owner.

**Certification Statement Required:**  
"I certify that reactivation of the specified process does not introduce unacceptable risk to the organization's financial integrity, regulatory compliance posture, or fiduciary obligations. I have reviewed root cause analysis, validated corrective action adequacy, and confirmed that no regulatory or legal impediments exist. I accept accountability for the risk assessment underlying this certification."

**Certification Basis:**  
Independent review of risk documentation, regulatory status confirmation, assessment of control remediation adequacy, and evaluation of residual risk acceptability.

---

### Certification Role 3: Financial or Human Resources Certification (Domain-Specific)

**Role Holder:**  
For incidents affecting financial reporting, treasury operations, or customer billing: Chief Financial Officer provides mandatory certification in addition to operational owner certification.

For incidents affecting payroll, benefits, or employee compensation: Chief Human Resources Officer provides mandatory certification in addition to operational owner certification.

For incidents affecting multiple domains: all applicable domain executives provide certification.

**Certification Statement Required:**  
"I certify that reactivation of the specified process will not compromise the accuracy of financial statements, the integrity of payroll execution, or the organization's obligations to employees and external stakeholders. I have validated that data corrections have been properly reflected in domain-specific records and that resumption of autonomous processing will not propagate prior errors."

**Certification Basis:**  
Domain-specific validation of data corrections, reconciliation review, assessment of financial statement or payroll impact, and confirmation of stakeholder obligation fulfillment.

---

### Certification Role 4: Internal Audit Attestation

**Role Holder:**  
Internal Audit Director or designated senior audit manager. This role must be fully independent of operational management and must not participate in process design or implementation.

**Certification Statement Required:**  
"I attest that the reactivation preconditions have been evaluated through independent audit procedures and that supporting documentation exists to substantiate each precondition certification. I have reviewed root cause analysis, corrective action evidence, and audit trail completeness. While I do not approve or disapprove the business decision to reactivate, I attest that the procedural requirements of this protocol have been followed and documented. I reserve the right to escalate to the Board Audit Committee if I determine that reactivation presents unacceptable control risk."

**Certification Basis:**  
Independent verification procedures including evidence review, stakeholder interviews, technical validation where required, and audit trail examination.

---

### Certification Role 5: Final Executive Authorization

**Role Holder:**  
Two of the following three executives, one of whom must be the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or Chief Operating Officer:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Financial Officer
- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Risk Officer
- General Counsel

**Authorization Statement Required:**  
"Based on the certifications provided by operational, risk, compliance, domain-specific, and internal audit parties, we authorize reactivation of the specified autonomous process effective [date and time]. We acknowledge that this authorization may be subject to regulatory and audit scrutiny. We accept accountability for this decision and commit to immediate re-suspension if post-reactivation monitoring reveals control deficiency."

**Authorization Basis:**  
Review of all subordinate certifications, assessment of organizational readiness, consideration of fiduciary duty, and exercise of executive judgment.

---

### Approval Prohibitions

The following conditions prohibit reactivation approval regardless of precondition satisfaction:

- Internal Audit Director explicitly objects to reactivation and escalates concern to Board Audit Committee
- General Counsel identifies legal impediment or regulatory prohibition
- External auditor (if consulting on the matter) advises against reactivation
- Board Audit Committee directs continued suspension pending additional review

---

## IV. REACTIVATION TIERS

### Purpose of Tiered Approach

Not all reactivations carry equal risk or require equal confidence. This protocol establishes three reactivation tiers providing progressively broader autonomous authority. All reactivations begin at Tier 1 (most restrictive) and advance through tiers only after demonstrating sustained stability and control effectiveness. Reactivation tier determination is not discretionary—advancement through tiers follows mandatory timelines and stability criteria.

---

### Tier 1: Restricted Reactivation

**Definition:**  
Restricted Reactivation permits autonomous process execution within narrowly defined scope boundaries, with transaction-level monitoring, mandatory executive notification for all significant actions, and immediate rollback capability maintained in ready state.

**What Is Allowed:**  
- Autonomous execution for transactions below materiality thresholds (e.g., journal entries < $10,000, inventory movements < 100 units, purchase orders < $5,000)
- Autonomous execution for low-risk transaction types explicitly whitelisted in reactivation authorization
- Autonomous execution during normal business hours only (08:00 - 17:00 local time)
- Autonomous execution with mandatory human review queue for all outputs before final commitment

**What Remains Blocked:**  
- Material transactions exceeding established thresholds
- High-risk transaction types including payment execution, payroll calculation, customer refunds, supplier master data changes, and approval overrides
- After-hours or weekend autonomous execution
- Cross-domain transactions affecting multiple business areas
- Any transaction type not explicitly whitelisted in authorization document

**Who Can Approve:**  
Tier 1 reactivation requires all certifications enumerated in Section III and final authorization from two executives per Section III Role 5 requirements.

**Duration Limits:**  
Tier 1 reactivation is time-bound with maximum duration of fourteen calendar days. If stability is not demonstrated within fourteen days, the process reverts to full suspension and requires fresh reactivation certification. Tier 1 may be extended once for an additional seven days with Chief Risk Officer approval.

**Monitoring Requirements:**  
- Real-time transaction monitoring with alerting for unusual patterns
- Daily reconciliation and variance reporting to process owner and Chief Risk Officer
- Executive summary report to authorizing executives every three business days
- Internal Audit spot-check procedures at minimum weekly frequency

**Advancement Criteria:**  
Advancement to Tier 2 requires fourteen consecutive days of Tier 1 operation with zero material errors, zero control violations, zero unexplained variances, and zero stakeholder complaints. Advancement requires written authorization from Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer or Chief Operating Officer (as applicable).

---

### Tier 2: Conditional Reactivation

**Definition:**  
Conditional Reactivation permits autonomous process execution at broader scope and materiality levels, with reduced but still elevated monitoring, periodic executive review checkpoints, and documented risk acceptance for residual uncertainties that could not be fully eliminated during investigation.

**What Is Allowed:**  
- Autonomous execution for transactions up to standard materiality thresholds (e.g., journal entries < $100,000, inventory movements < 1,000 units, purchase orders < $50,000)
- Autonomous execution for all transaction types except those explicitly designated as requiring permanent manual override
- Autonomous execution during extended hours (06:00 - 20:00 local time)
- Cross-domain transactions with enhanced logging and reconciliation procedures

**What Remains Blocked:**  
- Transactions exceeding elevated materiality thresholds requiring executive approval under normal operations
- High-consequence transaction types: payroll disbursement, customer refund above $10,000, supplier bank account changes, chart of accounts modifications, approval threshold changes
- Fully autonomous operation without periodic human verification (daily reconciliation remains mandatory)

**Who Can Approve:**  
Tier 2 advancement requires written authorization from Chief Risk Officer and either Chief Financial Officer or Chief Operating Officer depending on domain. Internal Audit Director must provide non-objection statement. If Internal Audit objects, advancement requires Board Audit Committee approval.

**Duration Limits:**  
Tier 2 reactivation is time-bound with maximum duration of sixty calendar days. After sixty days, the process either advances to Tier 3 (full reactivation), reverts to Tier 1 if stability concerns exist, or remains at Tier 2 with explicit risk acceptance and Board Audit Committee notification.

**Monitoring Requirements:**  
- Automated monitoring with weekly summary reporting to process owner and Chief Risk Officer
- Reconciliation procedures at normal operational frequency (typically daily or weekly depending on transaction volume)
- Monthly formal review meeting with process owner, risk officer, and internal audit
- Quarterly report to Board Audit Committee documenting Tier 2 operational performance

**Advancement Criteria:**  
Advancement to Tier 3 requires sixty consecutive days of Tier 2 operation with fewer than two non-material errors, zero material errors, zero control violations, successful completion of monthly review checkpoints, and Internal Audit Director recommendation for full reactivation.

---

### Tier 3: Full Reactivation

**Definition:**  
Full Reactivation restores autonomous process execution to normal operational scope, monitoring levels, and executive oversight consistent with processes that have not experienced kill-switch activation. Tier 3 represents operational normalization but includes permanent certification record and enhanced audit attention.

**What Is Allowed:**  
- Autonomous execution at full operational scope without artificial restrictions
- Normal materiality thresholds and approval authorities per standard operating procedures
- Normal operating hours and batch processing schedules
- Cross-domain transactions without additional monitoring beyond standard reconciliation

**What Remains Subject to Enhanced Control:**  
- Permanent notation in process control documentation that the process has previously experienced kill-switch activation
- Enhanced audit attention during annual external audit and internal audit cycles
- Mandatory annual revalidation of control design adequacy
- Immediate escalation to Chief Risk Officer if similar symptoms recur

**Who Can Approve:**  
Tier 3 advancement requires written authorization from Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer (for financial processes) or Chief Operating Officer (for operational processes). Internal Audit Director must provide explicit recommendation for full reactivation. Board Audit Committee must be notified of Tier 3 advancement (notification, not approval required).

**Duration Limits:**  
Tier 3 reactivation is permanent subject to annual revalidation. The process returns to normal operational governance but retains permanent historical record of prior incident.

**Monitoring Requirements:**  
- Standard operational monitoring per normal business processes
- Internal audit procedures include specific attention to previously failed controls
- Annual control revalidation must explicitly address prior incident and confirm that preventive measures remain effective

**Documentation Requirements:**  
- Permanent certification record documenting full reactivation authorization
- Permanent process control document notation identifying prior kill-switch incident and date of full reactivation
- Annual revalidation record confirming continued control effectiveness

---

### Tier Regression

If at any tier level the process exhibits control failure, unexplained variance, or behavior inconsistent with documented design, the process immediately regresses to the prior tier or full suspension depending on severity. Tier regression does not require multi-party approval—any executive with kill-switch activation authority per Phase 8.C-1B may immediately impose regression. Advancement following regression requires satisfaction of original advancement criteria plus additional Board Audit Committee notification.

---

## V. DOCUMENTATION & EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

### Mandatory Artifact Standard

Reactivation decisions must be supported by complete, organized, and audit-ready documentation. The absence of required documentation constitutes grounds for reactivation denial regardless of operational assertions of readiness. The documentation standard reflects the principle: **If it is not documented, it did not happen.**

---

**Prepared By:** Process Owner, Information Technology  
**Reviewed By:** Independent technical reviewer, Internal Audit Director  
**Approval:** Chief Information Officer, Chief Risk Officer

**Purpose:** Satisfies Precondition 2 and demonstrates that the organization addressed root cause rather than merely symptoms. This document substantiates the technical basis for reactivation.

---

### Artifact 4: Data Reconciliation Certification

**Required Content:**  
- Listing of all data inconsistencies identified during incident investigation
- Description of resolution method for each inconsistency
- Reconciliation procedures performed
- Residual discrepancies with justification for acceptance or write-off

**Prepared By:** Chief Risk Officer or designated governance administrator  
**Reviewed By:** General Counsel  
**Approval:** Final executive authorization per Section III Role 5

**Purpose:** Creates binding record of who authorized reactivation, on what basis, and with what restrictions. This document evidences governance process compliance and accountability.

---

### Artifact 6: Risk Acceptance Statements (If Applicable)

**Required Content:**  
- Identification of residual risks that could not be fully eliminated
- Justification for accepting residual risk rather than maintaining suspension
- Compensating controls or monitoring procedures addressing residual risk
- Executive sign-off accepting identified risks
- Board Audit Committee acknowledgment if residual risk is material

**Prepared By:** Chief Risk Officer  
**Reviewed By:** General Counsel  
**Approval:** Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or Chief Operating Officer

**Purpose:** Documents conscious risk-taking decisions and ensures executives explicitly acknowledge trade-offs involved in reactivation when uncertainty remains. Risk acceptance without documentation constitutes reckless decision-making.

---

### Artifact 7: Post-Reactivation Monitoring Plan

**Required Content:**  
- Specific metrics and thresholds triggering escalation
- Monitoring frequency and reporting schedule
- Responsible parties for monitoring execution and alert response
- Tier advancement checkpoints and criteria

**Reviewed By:** Chief Risk Officer  
**Approval:** Chief Financial Officer or Chief Operating Officer depending on domain

**Purpose:** Defines how the organization will detect post-reactivation control failures or recurrence. This document converts reactivation from one-time decision to ongoing oversight commitment.

---

### Document Retention and Accessibility

All reactivation artifacts must be retained for minimum seven years or longer if required by regulatory retention schedules or litigation hold. Documents must be stored in tamper-evident systems with access controls and audit logging. External auditors, regulatory examiners, and board committees must be able to access reactivation documentation upon request without delay.

---

## VI. FAILURE & ROLLBACK RULES

### Immediate Re-Suspension Authority

Any executive possessing kill-switch activation authority per Phase 8.C-1B may immediately re-suspend a reactivated process if post-reactivation monitoring reveals control deficiency, unexplained variance, stakeholder impact, or behavior inconsistent with documented design. Re-suspension authority is unilateral—no consultation, approval, or deliberation is required. Operational impact concerns do not override re-suspension authority.

### Automatic Re-Suspension Triggers

The following conditions automatically trigger re-suspension without requiring executive judgment or discretion:

- Material transaction error or misstatement detected
- Control violation documented through monitoring or audit procedures
- Data reconciliation failure indicating reemergence of prior inconsistency
- Stakeholder complaint related to process outputs (customer, supplier, employee, or regulatory)
- Similar incident pattern suggesting incomplete remediation
- Monitoring system failure preventing visibility into process operations
- Discovery of documentation inaccuracy or certification misstatement

When automatic trigger conditions occur, the process immediately reverts to suspension status. Process owners are notified but do not participate in re-suspension decision. Reactivation following automatic re-suspension requires full re-certification per Section III regardless of time elapsed since original reactivation.

### Repeat Incident Escalation

If a process experiences kill-switch activation more than once within any twelve-month rolling period, the second and subsequent incidents escalate to Board Audit Committee oversight. The Board Audit Committee determines whether:

- The process should remain permanently suspended pending fundamental redesign
- The process should continue under manual operation indefinitely
- The process should be decommissioned and replaced with alternative solution
- The process may be reactivated subject to additional executive accountability measures

Repeat incidents indicate structural process weakness that cannot be addressed through incremental remediation. Board-level oversight ensures that management does not repeatedly attempt reactivation of fundamentally flawed processes.

### Pattern Failure Implications

Three or more kill-switch activations affecting the same process within any twenty-four month period constitute pattern failure requiring independent third-party assessment. The organization must engage external process design specialists, control framework consultants, or other independent experts to evaluate process architecture and recommend structural solutions. Internal remediation efforts have failed to achieve lasting stability. External expertise is mandatory.

### Accountability for Failed Reactivation

If a reactivated process fails and re-suspension occurs, the executives who certified and authorized the original reactivation must provide written explanation to the Board Audit Committee addressing:

- What evidence they relied upon for reactivation authorization
- Why that evidence proved insufficient to predict post-reactivation failure
- What additional evidence or analysis would have revealed the latent deficiency
- What changes to reactivation protocol would prevent similar premature reactivation

This explanation requirement is not punitive. It is designed to create feedback loops improving reactivation judgment over time. However, executives who repeatedly certify unsuccessful reactivations may be subject to performance review or assignment modification.

---

## VII. REGULATORY & AUDIT DISCLOSURE

### Audit Reproducibility Standard

All reactivation decisions must be documented with sufficient detail and supporting evidence that external auditors can independently validate the reasonableness of the decision. Auditors reviewing reactivation decisions should be able to:

- Trace the incident from initial kill-switch activation through reactivation authorization
- Review evidence supporting each precondition certification
- Evaluate whether certifying parties possessed appropriate expertise and authority
- Assess whether the organization followed its own documented procedures
- Determine whether the reactivation decision reflected reasonable judgment

If auditors cannot validate reactivation reasonableness due to incomplete documentation, the reactivation decision may be cited as a control deficiency in audit reports and management letters.

### Regulatory Examination Cooperation

Regulatory examiners investigating control adequacy, process integrity, or incident response may request access to reactivation documentation. The organization will provide complete and timely access to all artifacts enumerated in Section V without requiring subpoena or formal demand. Voluntary cooperation demonstrates the organization's commitment to transparency and regulatory relationship management.

Regulatory examiners may ask:

- Who authorized reactivation and on what basis
- What evidence supported precondition certification
- Whether independent parties validated readiness
- What post-reactivation monitoring occurred
- Whether similar incidents have occurred previously
- What systemic improvements resulted from the incident

The organization's ability to answer these questions with documented evidence rather than verbal assertions determines regulatory confidence in management control effectiveness.

### Material Incident Disclosure

Kill-switch activations affecting financial reporting, payroll execution, customer billing, or regulatory filings may constitute material incidents requiring disclosure in financial statement footnotes, regulatory filings, or public communications depending on magnitude and stakeholder impact. General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer determine disclosure obligations in consultation with external auditors and legal advisors.

Failure to disclose material incidents when disclosure is required constitutes securities law, banking regulation, or corporate governance violation. Disclosure obligations override confidentiality or competitive concerns.

### Audit Committee Reporting

The Board Audit Committee receives quarterly reports summarizing all kill-switch activations, reactivations, and post-reactivation performance during the reporting period. The report includes:

- Number and nature of kill-switch activations
- Processes currently suspended and duration of suspension
- Reactivations authorized and current tier status
- Repeat incidents or pattern failures
- External audit or regulatory inquiries related to incidents

This reporting ensures board-level visibility into control effectiveness and incident response adequacy.

---

## VIII. POLICY CLOSING STATEMENT

### Supremacy of Fiduciary Duty

This Autonomy Reactivation & Certification Protocol reflects the principle that fiduciary duty supersedes operational convenience. Directors, officers, and senior managers of Ocean ERP bear legal accountability for the organization's control environment, financial accuracy, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder protection. Autonomous processes serve the organization; the organization does not serve autonomous processes.

When autonomous execution introduces unacceptable risk, suspension is mandatory. When suspension harms operational velocity, acceptance of reduced throughput is appropriate. The organization's long-term sustainability depends on control integrity, not short-term operational optimization.

### Explicit Rejection of Business Pressure

Operational pressure, revenue targets, customer commitments, competitive disadvantage, and executive impatience are explicitly excluded as considerations in reactivation decisions. These factors may create urgency for resolution but do not alter the requirement for documented control certainty before reactivation.

Executives who authorize premature reactivation under operational pressure, or who pressure subordinates to certify readiness when evidence is insufficient, breach their duty of care and expose themselves to personal accountability for subsequent failures.

### Personal Accountability of Signatories

Individuals who sign certification statements or authorization documents enumerated in Section III assume personal accountability for the accuracy and completeness of their certifications. These are not ceremonial signatures. They are professional attestations that may be scrutinized by auditors, regulators, boards, shareholders, and potentially courts.

Signatories who certify readiness based on incomplete evidence, who rely on verbal assurances without documentation, or who defer to operational pressure over control judgment, risk professional reputation and potential personal liability.

### Annual Review and Testing Requirement

This protocol is subject to annual review and update by the Chief Risk Officer in consultation with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and General Counsel. The protocol must be tested at least annually through tabletop exercises or simulated reactivation scenarios to ensure that certifying parties understand their obligations and that documentation procedures function effectively.

Processes that have never experienced kill-switch activation still benefit from reactivation protocol testing. The organization must not wait until an actual incident to discover procedural gaps or documentation deficiencies.

### Enforceability and Authority

This Autonomy Reactivation & Certification Protocol is effective immediately upon approval by the designated executive officers. Once approved, this protocol supersedes all prior informal reactivation practices, verbal authorization procedures, and undocumented judgment-based decisions.

No executive may authorize reactivation outside the procedures enumerated in this protocol. Attempts to circumvent this protocol constitute governance breaches subject to escalation and remediation.

The organization commits to operating suspended processes manually for as long as necessary to satisfy reactivation preconditions. Speed of reactivation is not a performance metric. Correctness of reactivation is the sole success criterion.
