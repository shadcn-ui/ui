**Authority:** CTO, Chief Data Officer, Executive Systems Architect  
**Audience:** CEO, COO, CFO, Board-Level Executives, Business Unit Heads  
**Related Policies:** Phase 1.1 Governance Framework, Phase 1.2 Workflow Engine Governance, Phase 1.3 Audit, Compliance & Traceability Governance

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the **non-negotiable governance requirements** for the Executive Signal & Decision Dashboard layer of Ocean ERP. It establishes the dashboard as a **decision control system**, not a reporting tool.

**The Executive Dashboard exists to:**
- Surface the single most critical decision required today
- Identify active risks requiring executive intervention
- Confirm business stability when no intervention is needed
- Provide clarity on cause, risk, and action

**Core Principle:**  
If a dashboard does not change a decision, it does not belong in the executive layer.

This is not a user interface specification. This is not a charting guide. This is a **decision control framework** that defines what qualifies as an executive signal, how trust is established, and what executives must never see.

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1 Dashboard as Control Cockpit

The Executive Dashboard is a **control cockpit**, not an analytics platform. It is designed to answer one question:

**"What must I act on TODAY?"**

It is not designed to:
- Satisfy curiosity
- Provide comprehensive views
- Enable exploration
- Showcase system capabilities

The dashboard serves decision-makers who have **limited time and ultimate accountability**. Every element must justify its presence by enabling or informing a decision.

### 1.2 Silence Means Stability

In aviation, cockpit silence means normal operation. Alarms sound only when intervention is required.

The Executive Dashboard operates on the same principle:

- **Silence = Stability:** When no signals are present, the business is operating within acceptable parameters.
- **Signal = Deviation:** When a signal appears, executive attention is required.
- **Noise = Risk:** Persistent low-priority signals indicate poor signal quality, not business activity.

**If the dashboard is always "red," it trains executives to ignore it.** Signal discipline is operational discipline.

### 1.3 Numbers Without Interpretation are Forbidden

Raw numbers without context are **cognitive overhead** and decision friction. Executives must not be required to:

- Remember baseline values
- Calculate variances mentally
- Determine whether a number is good or bad
- Infer causes from correlations

**Every number presented must be interpreted:**
- Is this deviation significant?
- Is this trend concerning?
- What is the business impact?
- What action is recommended?

Uninterpreted metrics are not signals. They are data dumping.

### 1.4 The Non-Negotiable Rule

**"If no action can be taken from a metric, it must not appear on the executive dashboard."**

This applies to:
- Vanity metrics (total users, all-time revenue)
- System health indicators (uptime, response time)
- Contextless percentages (conversion rate without baseline)
- Celebration metrics (badges earned, streaks maintained)

Action-free metrics belong in operational dashboards, not executive decision layers.

---

## 2. SIGNAL VS METRIC DISTINCTION

### 2.1 Definition of Metric

A **metric** is a raw measurement:

- Orders today: 1,200
- Inventory on hand: 45,000 units
- Cash balance: $2.3M
- Payroll cost this month: $185,000

Metrics are **data points**. They lack context, interpretation, and decision guidance.

### 2.2 Definition of Signal

A **signal** is an interpreted deviation that requires attention:

- **Orders down 45% vs 7-day baseline** due to paused marketing campaign → Risk: Revenue shortfall this quarter → Action: CFO review campaign budget
- **Inventory at 12 days vs 30-day safety stock policy** for top SKU → Risk: Stockout within 2 weeks → Action: COO expedite PO #4521
- **Cash balance below $2M policy threshold** due to delayed AR collection → Risk: Payroll funding gap next week → Action: CFO escalate collections

Signals are **decision triggers**. They provide:
- Deviation from expected state
- Business impact
- Recommended action
- Owner of action

### 2.3 Metric-to-Signal Transformation

No metric may surface on the Executive Dashboard without signal transformation:

| Raw Metric | Signal Interpretation | Action |
|------------|----------------------|--------|
| Orders today: 850 | Orders down 30% vs baseline, trend declining | Investigate campaign performance |
| AP aging > 90 days: $450K | AP overdue increased 80% this month, vendor escalations likely | CFO prioritize payment batch |
| Override count: 47 this week | Overrides up 3x vs last month, governance erosion detected | COO audit override justifications |

**Prohibited practice:** Displaying "Orders: 850" without deviation context, trend, or action.

### 2.4 Signal Narrative Requirement

Every signal must include a **plain-language narrative** that a non-technical executive can understand in 5 seconds:

✅ **Good signal:**  
"Top SKU will stockout in 9 days. Purchase order #4521 is awaiting approval. Approve now to prevent lost sales."

❌ **Bad signal:**  
"Inventory velocity ratio 4.2x, lead time variance +15%, reorder point breached."

The bad signal uses jargon, lacks business impact, and provides no action.

---

## 3. SIGNAL SOURCES (TRUST BOUNDARY)

### 3.1 Trusted Data Sources

Executive signals may **only** originate from data that has passed through the trust boundary established in Phase 1.3:

| Source | Trust Level | Qualification |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Audited Transactions** | Trusted | Data with complete audit trails (Phase 1.3) |
| **Approved Workflows** | Trusted | Actions that completed Phase 1.2 approval process |
| **Authorized Governance Rules** | Trusted | Policies defined in Phase 1.1 authority matrix |

### 3.2 Untrusted Data Sources

The following data sources are **prohibited** from contributing to executive signals:

- **Unaudited manual entries** (spreadsheet uploads, CSV imports without validation)
- **Manually edited aggregations** (someone "fixed" the number in the database)
- **External systems without reconciliation** (marketplace data not validated against internal records)
- **Draft or pending records** (orders not yet approved, invoices not yet posted)
- **Cached or stale data** (snapshot older than acceptable freshness window)

### 3.3 Audit Confidence Marking

Every signal must carry an **audit confidence level**:

- **100% Confident:** All source data is audited, complete, and reconciled
- **Degraded Confidence:** Some source data is incomplete or awaiting reconciliation
- **Untrusted:** Source data bypassed audit or governance controls

**Rule:** If audit confidence < 100%, the signal must be visually marked as **"UNTRUSTED"** and should not trigger automated actions.

Executives must know when they are making decisions on incomplete information.

### 3.4 Data Freshness Requirements

Signals must disclose data freshness:

- **Real-time:** Data accurate within 1 minute (for operational signals)
- **Near real-time:** Data accurate within 15 minutes (for most business signals)
- **Hourly:** Data refreshed every hour (for inventory, fulfillment signals)
- **Daily:** Data refreshed overnight (for financial, compliance signals)

**Prohibited:** Showing yesterday's data without disclosure. Stale data presented as current is misrepresentation.

---

## 4. EXECUTIVE SIGNAL CATEGORIES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 4.1 Mandatory Signal Domains

The Executive Dashboard must monitor and signal across the following **mandatory domains**. These domains are non-optional and must be implemented before the dashboard is considered production-ready.

#### A. Revenue & Demand Signals

**Purpose:** Detect revenue risk before it materializes.

Signal examples:
- **Order volume deviation:** Orders down X% vs baseline (7-day, 30-day, seasonal)
- **Channel concentration risk:** Single channel now represents >50% of orders (was 30% last month)
- **Campaign spike or collapse:** Marketing campaign drove 3x order surge; campaign paused yesterday, orders dropped 60%
- **Customer churn signal:** Top 10 customers reduced order frequency by 40% this quarter

**Risk mapping:**
- **Critical:** Revenue decline >30% without known cause
- **High:** Single channel concentration >60%
- **Medium:** Order volume variance >15%

#### B. Fulfillment & Operations Risk

**Purpose:** Prevent SLA breaches and customer dissatisfaction.

Signal examples:
- **SLA breach trend:** Late shipments increased from 2% to 8% this week
- **Fulfillment lag accumulation:** Average order-to-ship time is 4.5 days vs 2-day SLA
- **Backlog buildup:** Unfulfilled orders reached 1,200 (2x normal level)
- **Capacity constraint:** Warehouse operating at 95% capacity, cannot absorb expected campaign surge

**Risk mapping:**
- **Critical:** SLA breach rate >10% or backlog >3x normal
- **High:** SLA breach rate 5-10%
- **Medium:** Fulfillment lag trending upward

#### C. Inventory Risk Signals

**Purpose:** Prevent stockouts and overstock write-offs.

Signal examples:
- **Imminent stockout:** Top SKU will stockout in 9 days, PO awaiting approval
- **Overstock exposure:** $850K inventory aging >120 days, seasonal demand ended
- **Allocation vs availability mismatch:** Allocated 5,000 units but only 3,200 on hand
- **Supplier delay cascade:** Lead time for critical component increased from 14 to 45 days

**Risk mapping:**
- **Critical:** Stockout within 7 days for top-revenue SKU
- **High:** Overstock exposure >$500K
- **Medium:** Inventory aging >90 days increasing

#### D. Financial Control Signals

**Purpose:** Protect cash flow, margin, and financial statement integrity.

Signal examples:
- **Margin erosion:** Gross margin dropped from 42% to 35% this month due to unplanned discounts
- **Cash flow pressure:** Cash balance below $2M policy threshold, projected shortfall in 10 days
- **AR aging anomaly:** >90-day receivables increased 120% this quarter
- **AP payment backlog:** $1.2M in overdue payables, vendor credit holds imminent
- **Budget variance:** Operating expenses 25% over budget with no variance approval

**Risk mapping:**
- **Critical:** Cash shortfall within 14 days, margin erosion >10 points
- **High:** AR aging >90 days increasing >50%
- **Medium:** Budget variance >15%

#### E. Governance & Compliance Signals

**Purpose:** Detect governance erosion and compliance risk before audit failure.

Signal examples:
- **Override spike:** Approval overrides increased 300% this month (from 5/month to 20/month)
- **Repeated escalation pattern:** Same workflow escalates to CEO 12 times this quarter
- **Policy breach frequency:** Segregation of duties violated 8 times this week
- **Immutability violation attempt:** 3 attempts to edit closed period journal entries detected
- **Audit failure event:** Audit log write failure occurred, operations temporarily halted

**Risk mapping:**
- **Critical:** Immutability violation, audit failure
- **High:** Override frequency >2x baseline, SoD violations >5/week
- **Medium:** Escalation pattern suggests process failure

### 4.2 Signal Severity Classification

Every signal must be assigned a **risk severity**:

| Severity | Definition | Executive Response Time |
|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate business continuity risk, financial/legal exposure | Within 4 hours |
| **High** | Material business impact, requires decision today | Within 24 hours |
| **Medium** | Trend requiring monitoring, decision this week | Within 5 business days |
| **Low** | Informational, no immediate action required | No time constraint |

**Rule:** Low-severity signals must not appear on the executive dashboard. They belong in operational dashboards.

### 4.3 Signal Time Sensitivity

Every signal must specify **time sensitivity**:

- **Immediate:** Decision required within hours (cash shortfall, stockout imminent)
- **Today:** Decision required by end of business day
- **This Week:** Decision required within 5 business days

**Prohibited:** Signals without time sensitivity. Executives must know what is urgent.

---

## 5. SIGNAL CONSTRUCTION RULES

### 5.1 Mandatory Signal Components

Every executive signal must include the following components. **Omission of any component renders the signal invalid.**

| Component | Requirement | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Deviation Statement** | Clear description of what changed | "Orders down 45% vs 7-day baseline" |
| **Business Impact** | Plain-language consequence | "Revenue shortfall of $320K projected this quarter" |
| **Root Cause Hypothesis** | Most likely reason (if determinable) | "Due to paused marketing campaign since Jan 3" |
| **Recommended Action** | Specific next step | "Review campaign budget and restart high-performing ads" |
| **Action Owner** | Role responsible for decision | "CMO (Marketing), escalate to CFO if budget impact >$100K" |

### 5.2 Signal Narrative Structure

Signals must follow this narrative structure:

**[Deviation Statement]**  
**Impact:** [Business consequence]  
**Cause:** [Root cause hypothesis or "Under investigation"]  
**Action:** [Recommended next step]  
**Owner:** [Decision-making role]  
**Urgency:** [Immediate / Today / This Week]

Example:

**"Top SKU will stockout in 9 days"**  
**Impact:** Lost sales estimated at $85K if not restocked  
**Cause:** Supplier shipment delayed 3 weeks due to port congestion  
**Action:** Approve emergency air freight for PO #4521 or source alternate supplier  
**Owner:** COO (Operations), CFO approval required if cost >$10K  
**Urgency:** Decision required today

### 5.3 Action Ownership Requirement

**No signal may exist without an action owner.**

Action ownership must specify:

- **Primary owner:** The role responsible for the decision (CFO, COO, CMO, etc.)
- **Escalation path:** If primary owner does not act within time sensitivity window
- **Authority alignment:** Reference to Phase 1.1 authority matrix

**Prohibited:** Signals that say "Review" or "Monitor" without specifying who is responsible.

### 5.4 Signal Uniqueness

Each signal must be **uniquely identifiable** to support:

- Acknowledgment tracking (executive has seen the signal)
- Resolution tracking (executive has acted on the signal)
- Escalation tracking (signal was ignored, escalation triggered)

Signal IDs must be immutable and auditable.

---

## 6. WHAT EXECUTIVES MUST NEVER SEE

### 6.1 Prohibited Content

The following content is **explicitly prohibited** from executive dashboards:

#### Raw Tables
- Transaction lists
- Order line items
- Payment details
- Employee records

**Reason:** Executives make decisions on aggregated signals, not raw transactions.

#### Technical Identifiers
- Database IDs
- UUIDs
- Internal codes (SKU-ABC-12345-XYZ)
- API endpoints

**Reason:** Technical identifiers are meaningless to business decision-makers.

#### System Health Metrics
- CPU usage
- Memory consumption
- API response times
- Database query performance

**Reason:** System health is an IT concern, not a business decision input.

#### Feature Completeness Indicators
- "Module 80% complete"
- "Integration in progress"
- "Testing phase 2 of 5"

**Reason:** Internal project status is not an executive decision trigger.

#### Vanity Metrics
- Total all-time users
- Cumulative revenue (without context)
- Social media followers
- Page views

**Reason:** These metrics do not inform today's decisions.

#### SQL-Like Aggregations
- "SUM(revenue) WHERE date > X"
- "COUNT(orders) GROUP BY channel"
- "AVG(fulfillment_time)"

**Reason:** Executives consume interpreted signals, not database queries.

### 6.2 The Drill-Down Prohibition

Executives must **not** be able to drill down into raw data from the dashboard.

**Rationale:**
- Executives operate at signal level, not transaction level
- Drill-down encourages micro-management
- Raw data lacks governance and audit context
- Transaction-level decisions belong to operations, not executives

**If an executive needs transaction detail, the appropriate action is:**
1. Request a formal audit report (Phase 1.3)
2. Delegate investigation to operations
3. Trigger a governance review (Phase 1.1)

The dashboard is a **decision control layer**, not a data exploration tool.

### 6.3 The Customization Prohibition

Executives must **not** be able to customize the dashboard layout, add metrics, or remove signals.

**Rationale:**
- Dashboard integrity depends on consistent signal definitions
- Customization creates divergent views of truth
- Executives may hide critical signals or add irrelevant metrics
- Auditors and board members must see identical dashboards

**The dashboard is a governance artifact, not a personal analytics tool.**

If an executive requests a custom metric, it must:
1. Be formally reviewed by CTO/CDO
2. Be justified as a decision trigger
3. Be implemented system-wide, not per-user

---

## 7. EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD STRUCTURE (LOGICAL)

### 7.1 Hierarchical Design Principle

The Executive Dashboard follows a strict **information hierarchy** designed to minimize cognitive load and maximize decision speed.

#### Hierarchy Layers

**1️⃣ Focus Today (Single Most Critical Signal)**

- The **one signal** requiring the most urgent executive attention
- Determined by algorithm: severity × time sensitivity × business impact
- Changes as signals are acknowledged or resolved
- If no critical/high signals exist, this section may show "No urgent decisions required"

**2️⃣ Required Decisions (Maximum 3)**

- The **top 3 signals** requiring executive decisions within 24 hours
- Ranked by urgency and impact
- Each signal includes action owner and recommended next step
- **If more than 3 signals are "required," the system has failed at prioritization**

**3️⃣ Active Risks (Prioritized List)**

- **Up to 10 medium-severity signals** requiring decisions this week
- Ranked by time sensitivity
- Grouped by domain (Revenue, Operations, Inventory, Financial, Governance)
- Each includes escalation countdown (e.g., "Escalates in 3 days")

**4️⃣ Business Health Summary**

- **High-level status indicators** across key domains
- Uses plain language: "Revenue: On track," "Fulfillment: Behind target," "Cash: Healthy"
- Not detailed metrics; just directional health
- Purpose: Confirm that non-signaled areas are stable

**5️⃣ Confirmation of Stability**

- Explicit statement when no risks are active: "All operations within normal parameters"
- Prevents executives from assuming "no signal = missing data"
- Builds trust that silence means stability

### 7.2 The Three-Decision Rule

**If more than 3 decisions are marked "Required Decisions," the system has failed.**

This indicates:
- Poor prioritization logic
- Signal fatigue (too many low-value signals)
- Operational breakdown (too many simultaneous issues)

**System response:**
- Flag as escalation event to CTO/COO
- Force re-ranking of signals
- Investigate why normal operations are generating excessive decision load

### 7.3 Time-of-Day Awareness

The dashboard must adapt to **executive working patterns**:

- **Morning (8-10 AM):** Present overnight signals, critical decisions for the day
- **Midday (10 AM-2 PM):** Update with emerging trends, escalations
- **Afternoon (2-5 PM):** Highlight unresolved signals, escalation warnings
- **Evening (5 PM+):** Summarize day's decisions, preview tomorrow's critical signals

Executives should not receive low-priority signals during critical decision windows.

---

## 8. DECISION LATENCY & ESCALATION

### 8.1 Signal Acknowledgment Requirement

When a signal appears on the Executive Dashboard, it must be **acknowledged** by the responsible executive within the time sensitivity window.

Acknowledgment means:
- Executive has seen the signal
- Executive has reviewed the recommendation
- Executive has taken or delegated action

**Acknowledgment does not mean resolution.** It means the decision-making process has begun.

### 8.2 Escalation Triggers

If a signal is **not acknowledged** within the time sensitivity window, automatic escalation occurs:

| Original Severity | Time Window | Escalation Target |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | 4 hours | CEO, Board Audit Committee |
| **High** | 24 hours | CEO |
| **Medium** | 5 business days | COO / CFO (peer review) |

### 8.3 Escalation Visibility

Escalated signals must be **visible** to:
- The original action owner (who failed to acknowledge)
- The escalation target (CEO, board, etc.)
- The audit trail (Phase 1.3 logs the escalation event)

**Ignored signals are governance failures** and must be treated as such.

### 8.4 Repeat Escalation as System Failure

If the **same signal type** escalates more than 3 times in a quarter, it indicates:

- Process failure (signal should not be reaching executive level)
- Authority misalignment (wrong owner assigned)
- Prioritization failure (signal is not actually executive-level)

**System response:**
- Flag as governance review event
- Investigate root cause
- Potentially reclassify signal as operational, not executive

### 8.5 The Consequence of Silence

**Silence must have consequences.**

If executives consistently ignore signals, the dashboard loses credibility. The system must:

1. **Track acknowledgment rates** by executive and signal type
2. **Report patterns** to CEO/board (e.g., "CFO acknowledged 12/15 financial signals this quarter")
3. **Trigger governance review** if acknowledgment rate falls below 80%

Executives are accountable for their attention to signals.

---

## 9. SIGNAL DECAY & RESOLUTION

### 9.1 Signal Lifecycle

Every signal has a lifecycle:

1. **Created:** Signal generated by detection algorithm
2. **Active:** Signal appears on executive dashboard
3. **Acknowledged:** Executive has seen and is acting on signal
4. **Resolved:** Underlying deviation has been corrected
5. **Archived:** Signal moved to historical audit trail

### 9.2 Auto-Resolution Conditions

A signal may **auto-resolve** when:

- The deviation returns to normal parameters (e.g., inventory restocked, orders recovered)
- The time-sensitive window has passed and the risk is no longer material
- A compensating action was taken (e.g., alternate supplier sourced, campaign restarted)

**Auto-resolution requires:**
- Audit log entry documenting resolution
- Confirmation that business state has returned to acceptable parameters
- No manual "dismiss" or "hide" functionality

### 9.3 Manual Resolution

Executives may **manually resolve** a signal by:

- Confirming that action was taken
- Providing resolution notes (e.g., "Approved emergency PO," "Restarted campaign")
- Accepting the risk without action (requires justification)

**Manual resolution generates an audit event** (Phase 1.3) linking:
- The signal ID
- The executive who resolved it
- The resolution action taken
- The timestamp of resolution

### 9.4 Resolution Trace Requirement

Every resolved signal must be **traceable**:

- Why did the signal appear?
- What action was taken?
- When was it resolved?
- What was the business outcome?

Resolution without trace is prohibited. Signals cannot simply "disappear."

### 9.5 Repeated Signal Grouping

If the **same underlying issue** generates multiple signals (e.g., stockout for SKU-A, stockout for SKU-B, stockout for SKU-C), the system must:

- **Group related signals** into a single executive alert: "Stockout risk across 3 top SKUs"
- **Prevent signal spam** (executives don't need 10 similar alerts)
- **Preserve individual signal detail** for operational drill-down (not executive view)

Grouping logic must be transparent and auditable.

---

## 10. EXECUTIVE TRUST RULES

### 10.1 Reproducibility Guarantee

Every signal presented on the Executive Dashboard must be **reproducible** from source data.

This means:
- An auditor can query the underlying audit logs (Phase 1.3) and verify the signal
- Signal calculations are deterministic (same inputs = same outputs)
- No randomness, sampling, or approximation in executive signals

**If a signal cannot be reproduced, it must not be shown.**

### 10.2 Consistency Guarantee

Signal logic must be **consistent across time periods**.

- The algorithm that detects "orders down 30%" in January must use the same logic in February
- Baseline definitions must not shift without executive notification
- Threshold changes (e.g., changing "high severity" from >20% to >25%) require governance approval

**Inconsistent signal logic destroys trust.**

### 10.3 Cross-Device Truth Guarantee

Executives must see **identical signals** regardless of device or access method:

- Desktop dashboard = mobile dashboard = PDF export
- No "demo mode" or "simplified view"
- No delayed sync causing divergent numbers

**If the CEO sees different numbers than the CFO, trust is broken.**

### 10.4 No Demo Mode in Production

**Production dashboards must never use demo or synthetic data.**

This seems obvious, but common violations include:

- "Prettified" charts with smoothed or interpolated data
- Test signals left in production
- Placeholder metrics pending real data integration
- "Expected" values shown instead of actual values

**Every number on the executive dashboard must be auditable and true.**

### 10.5 The One Truth Principle

There must be **one source of truth** for each metric.

- Revenue reported on the executive dashboard = revenue in financial reports = revenue in audit logs
- No parallel calculation paths
- No adjustments or rounding without disclosure

**If different systems report different numbers, the dashboard is untrusted until reconciled.**

---

## 11. GOVERNANCE INTEGRATION

### 11.1 Phase Dependency Model

Phase 1.4 is the **final layer** in the governance stack and consumes outputs from all prior phases:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE 1.4: Executive Signal & Dashboard    │
│  "What must be done next?"                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ▲
                    │ Consumes
                    │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE 1.3: Audit & Traceability            │
│  "What happened?"                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ▲
                    │ Records
                    │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE 1.2: Workflow Engine                 │
│  "How are decisions executed?"              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ▲
                    │ Enforces
                    │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE 1.1: Governance Framework            │
│  "Who can decide?"                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 11.2 Authority Alignment (Phase 1.1)

Every signal's **action owner** must be validated against the Phase 1.1 authority matrix:

- If a signal assigns action to "CFO," the CFO role must have authority over the domain
- If a signal recommends approval, the approval threshold must align with Phase 1.1
- If a signal requires escalation, the escalation path must follow Phase 1.1 hierarchy

**Signals cannot assign actions to roles without authority.**

### 11.3 Workflow Integration (Phase 1.2)

Signals derived from **workflow events** must reflect Phase 1.2 governance:

- Override signals indicate workflow bypass (governance erosion)
- Escalation signals indicate approval timeout (process failure)
- Approval backlog signals indicate insufficient delegation

**Phase 1.4 surfaces Phase 1.2 failures as executive decisions.**

### 11.4 Audit Trust (Phase 1.3)

All signals must be **auditable** per Phase 1.3 requirements:

- Signal generation is logged as an audit event
- Signal acknowledgment is logged
- Signal resolution is logged
- Signal data sources are traceable to audited transactions

**If audit confidence is degraded, signals must be marked untrusted.**

### 11.5 The Governance Loop

The four phases form a **closed governance loop**:

1. **Phase 1.1** defines authority → Executives know who can act
2. **Phase 1.2** enforces approval → Actions cannot bypass governance
3. **Phase 1.3** records truth → Actions are auditable and immutable
4. **Phase 1.4** surfaces exceptions → Executives see governance failures

**No audit = no trusted signals.**  
**No trusted signals = no executive dashboard.**

---

## 12. FAILURE MODES

### 12.1 Contradictory Signals

**Scenario:** Two signals provide conflicting interpretations.

Example:
- Signal A: "Inventory overstock: 60 days on hand for SKU-X"
- Signal B: "Stockout risk: SKU-X projected to deplete in 10 days"

**System response:**
1. **Flag the contradiction** as a data integrity issue
2. **Surface both signals** with "CONFLICT DETECTED" marker
3. **Prevent automated actions** based on either signal
4. **Escalate to data integrity review** (CTO/CDO)
5. **Require manual resolution** before either signal is actionable

**Do not suppress contradictions.** Executives must know when data is inconsistent.

### 12.2 Incomplete Data

**Scenario:** A signal cannot be calculated because source data is missing.

Example:
- Cannot calculate "orders vs baseline" because baseline data is unavailable
- Cannot determine "cash flow pressure" because bank reconciliation is incomplete

**System response:**
1. **Do not fabricate the signal** with assumptions or estimates
2. **Surface a meta-signal:** "Revenue signal unavailable due to incomplete data"
3. **Identify the missing data source** and owner
4. **Treat as operational failure** (data pipeline broken)

**Silence is better than false confidence.**

### 12.3 Audit Confidence Degraded

**Scenario:** Audit logs (Phase 1.3) indicate incomplete or failed audit capture for transactions contributing to a signal.

**System response:**
1. **Mark all dependent signals as "UNTRUSTED"**
2. **Surface audit failure** as a critical governance signal
3. **Prevent signals from triggering automated workflows**
4. **Escalate to CFO/CTO** immediately
5. **Block financial reporting** until audit integrity is restored

**Audit failure is system failure.** Dashboards cannot operate on untrusted data.

### 12.4 Signal Algorithm Failure

**Scenario:** The signal detection algorithm produces an obviously incorrect result.

Example:
- Signal claims "orders down 99%" when visual inspection shows normal activity
- Signal claims "cash balance negative" when bank statements show positive balance

**System response:**
1. **Suppress the invalid signal** from executive view
2. **Log the failure** as a critical system event
3. **Alert engineering team** to investigate algorithm bug
4. **Notify executives** that a signal category is temporarily unavailable
5. **Do not attempt auto-correction** (may mask deeper issues)

**A broken signal is worse than no signal.**

### 12.5 Conservative Interpretation Default

When faced with ambiguity, the system must **default to conservative interpretation**:

- If data quality is uncertain, assume higher risk
- If severity is borderline, escalate to higher severity
- If action is ambiguous, assign to higher authority

**Better to over-alert than to miss a critical decision.**

However, persistent over-alerting indicates signal calibration failure and must be addressed through governance review.

---

## ENFORCEMENT & ACCOUNTABILITY

### Dashboard Governance Review

This dashboard governance framework is reviewed **quarterly** by:

- CEO (final authority on executive needs)
- CFO (financial signal accuracy)
- COO (operational signal relevance)
- CTO (technical feasibility and audit alignment)
- Chief Data Officer (signal quality and trust boundaries)

Updates require CEO approval.

### Signal Quality Metrics

The following metrics are tracked and reported to executive leadership **monthly**:

- Signal acknowledgment rate by executive
- Signal false-positive rate (signals that auto-resolved without action)
- Signal latency (time from deviation to signal generation)
- Escalation frequency by signal type
- Audit confidence level across signal sources
- Signal contradiction or failure events

These metrics measure dashboard credibility.

### Executive Training Requirement

All executives with dashboard access must complete **governance training** covering:

- What qualifies as a signal vs. a metric
- How to acknowledge and resolve signals
- Escalation paths and consequences
- Trust boundaries and audit confidence
- What they should never see (and why)

**Untrained executives cannot access the dashboard.**

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Executives do not need more dashboards. They need **decision clarity**.

The Executive Signal & Decision Dashboard exists to answer four questions:

1. **What is happening?** (Deviation from normal)
2. **What is going wrong?** (Business impact)
3. **What decision is required?** (Recommended action)
4. **What happens if I do nothing?** (Risk consequence)

If a dashboard element does not answer one of these questions, it is noise. Noise distracts from critical decisions. Distraction is operational risk.

The dashboard is not a celebration of data availability. It is a **control mechanism** that surfaces the right decision at the right time to the right authority.

**A dashboard that does not guide decisions is noise. Noise is operational risk.**
