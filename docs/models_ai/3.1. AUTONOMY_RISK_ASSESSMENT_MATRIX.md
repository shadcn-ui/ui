# PHASE 3.1: AUTONOMY RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX (PER DOMAIN)

**Document Classification:** Internal Policy — Binding  
**Effective Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Authority:** CTO, Chief Risk Officer, Head of Internal Audit, Operations Control Architect  
**Audience:** CTO, COO, CFO, CIO/CDO, Internal Audit, Enterprise Risk Committee, Board Audit Committee  
**Related Policies:** Phase 3.0 Autonomous Operations & Continuous Optimization Governance

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the **domain-by-domain risk assessment** for autonomous operations within Ocean ERP. It establishes explicit classifications of where autonomy is safe, restricted, or forbidden, and the safeguards required for each capability.

**Core Principle:**  
Autonomy is not a binary decision. Autonomy is a **controlled gradient of risk**. Every autonomous capability must be explicitly evaluated, classified, approved, and continuously monitored.

**Purpose:**
- Prevent autonomous operations from creating uncontrolled risk
- Establish clear accountability for autonomous failures
- Provide a decision framework for evaluating autonomy requests
- Enable auditors and risk committees to assess autonomy exposure

**This document is binding.** It overrides feature ambition. It protects the enterprise from silent failure.

**No domain is autonomous by default.**

---

## SECTION 1: AUTONOMY RISK FRAMEWORK

### 1.1 Four-Dimensional Risk Assessment

Every capability considered for autonomy must be evaluated across **four mandatory risk dimensions**:

#### Risk Dimension 1: FINANCIAL IMPACT RISK

**Definition:** The potential financial harm if autonomous action executes incorrectly or based on bad data.

**Assessment criteria:**
- **Low (🟢):** Financial impact <$5K per action, easily reversible
- **Moderate (🟡):** Financial impact $5K-$50K per action, reversible with effort
- **High (🟠):** Financial impact $50K-$500K per action, difficult to reverse
- **Critical (🔴):** Financial impact >$500K per action, irreversible or affects financial statements

**Examples:**
- 🟢 Auto-send payment reminder email (no financial transaction)
- 🟡 Auto-approve purchase order ≤$5K (reversible, bounded impact)
- 🟠 Auto-adjust inventory valuation (affects COGS, margin reporting)
- 🔴 Auto-post revenue recognition journal entries (affects financial statements, audit exposure)

#### Risk Dimension 2: OPERATIONAL CASCADE RISK

**Definition:** The potential for autonomous failure to trigger cascading failures in dependent systems or processes.

**Assessment criteria:**
- **Low (🟢):** Failure contained to single transaction, no downstream impact
- **Moderate (🟡):** Failure affects 1-2 downstream processes, recoverable
- **High (🟠):** Failure cascades across 3+ processes, requires coordinated recovery
- **Critical (🔴):** Failure cascades system-wide, affects customer fulfillment or regulatory compliance

**Examples:**
- 🟢 Auto-route fulfillment to warehouse A vs B (localized decision)
- 🟡 Auto-reorder inventory (affects procurement, inventory, potentially cash flow)
- 🟠 Auto-allocate inventory (affects fulfillment, customer promises, revenue recognition)
- 🔴 Auto-adjust credit limits (affects orders, fulfillment, AR, collections, customer relationships)

#### Risk Dimension 3: REGULATORY / COMPLIANCE RISK

**Definition:** The potential for autonomous action to violate legal, regulatory, tax, or audit requirements.

**Assessment criteria:**
- **Low (🟢):** No regulatory impact, purely operational decision
- **Moderate (🟡):** Indirect compliance impact, auditable but low risk
- **High (🟠):** Direct compliance impact, requires documentation and justification
- **Critical (🔴):** Violates regulatory requirements, creates legal exposure, audit failure risk

**Examples:**
- 🟢 Auto-prioritize fulfillment queue based on ship date (operational only)
- 🟡 Auto-generate draft journal entries for review (audit trail preserved)
- 🟠 Auto-adjust tax classification for products (tax compliance risk)
- 🔴 Auto-post payroll without approval (labor law, tax withholding, audit risk)

#### Risk Dimension 4: REVERSIBILITY RISK

**Definition:** The difficulty and business impact of reversing an autonomous action if it proves incorrect.

**Assessment criteria:**
- **Low (🟢):** Easily reversible within minutes, no business impact
- **Moderate (🟡):** Reversible within hours/days, minor business impact
- **High (🟠):** Reversible but requires cross-functional coordination, material impact
- **Critical (🔴):** Irreversible or reversal creates legal/financial harm

**Examples:**
- 🟢 Auto-send notification (can send correction, low impact)
- 🟡 Auto-create purchase order (can cancel before supplier ships)
- 🟠 Auto-ship order to customer (can recall but costs shipping, customer trust impact)
- 🔴 Auto-pay supplier (funds transferred, requires supplier cooperation to reverse)

### 1.2 Composite Risk Score

Each capability receives a **composite risk score** based on the highest risk dimension:

**Composite Risk = MAX(Financial Risk, Cascade Risk, Compliance Risk, Reversibility Risk)**

**Rationale:** A capability is only as safe as its highest-risk dimension. If any dimension is Critical (🔴), the capability is Critical risk overall.

---

## SECTION 2: AUTONOMY RISK LEVELS

### 2.1 Four Autonomy Risk Classes

Every capability is classified into exactly one risk class based on composite risk score:

#### 🟢 LOW RISK (Green)

**Definition:** Autonomous action has minimal financial, operational, compliance, and reversibility risk.

**Characteristics:**
- Financial impact <$5K per action
- Failure contained to single transaction
- No regulatory compliance impact
- Easily reversible within minutes

**Autonomy Tiers Allowed:**

- Level 4 (Self-tuning optimization) — with quarterly review

**Required Safeguards:**
- Audit trail (Phase 1.3)
- Performance monitoring (Phase 2.0)
- Quarterly performance review

**Approval Authority:**
- VP Operations + CTO approval to enable

**Examples:**
- Auto-send order confirmation emails
- Auto-route fulfillment based on proximity
- Auto-prioritize picking queue by ship date

---

#### 🟡 MODERATE RISK (Yellow)

**Definition:** Autonomous action has manageable risk but requires oversight and guardrails.

**Characteristics:**
- Financial impact $5K-$50K per action
- Failure affects 1-2 downstream processes
- Indirect compliance impact
- Reversible with effort within days

**Autonomy Tiers Allowed:**
- Level 2 (Auto-action with approval) — preferred
- Level 3 (Auto-action within guardrails) — only with strict thresholds and monthly review

**Required Safeguards:**
- Strict financial/quantity guardrails
- Pre-action validation checks
- Daily alert on exceptions
- Monthly performance review

**Approval Authority:**
- COO + CTO + CFO approval to enable

**Examples:**
- Auto-reorder inventory ≤$5K per order
- Auto-approve purchase orders within budget
- Auto-adjust safety stock ±10%

---

#### 🟠 HIGH RISK (Orange)

**Definition:** Autonomous action carries material risk and requires human judgment for most cases.

**Characteristics:**
- Financial impact $50K-$500K per action
- Failure cascades across 3+ processes
- Direct compliance impact requiring documentation
- Difficult to reverse, material business impact

**Autonomy Tiers Allowed:**
- Level 1 (Recommendation only) — strongly preferred
- Level 2 (Auto-action with approval) — only for proven, stable use cases with CFO sign-off

**Required Safeguards:**
- Recommendation engine with human decision
- Explicit approval workflow (Phase 1.2)
- Real-time executive visibility (Phase 1.4)
- Weekly performance review
- Escalation on any anomaly
- Post-action verification required

**Approval Authority:**
- COO + CTO + CFO approval + quarterly board reporting

**Examples:**
- Large purchase orders >$50K
- Credit limit increases
- Pricing changes affecting margin
- Inventory write-offs

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL RISK (Red)

**Definition:** Autonomous action is **forbidden** or permitted only under extraordinary safeguards with board approval.

**Characteristics:**
- Financial impact >$500K per action or affects financial statements
- System-wide cascade risk
- Regulatory violation risk, legal exposure
- Irreversible or reversal creates material harm

**Autonomy Tiers Allowed:**
- Level 0 (Manual only) — default and strongly recommended
- Level 1 (Recommendation only) — only if extensive historical validation + board approval

**Required Safeguards (if Level 1 permitted):**
- Mandatory human approval for every action
- Dual authorization (two-person rule)
- Real-time CFO/COO visibility
- External audit notification
- Daily executive review
- Quarterly board risk reporting

**Approval Authority:**
- Board Audit Committee approval required

**Examples:**
- Journal entry posting
- Payroll execution
- Revenue recognition
- Inventory valuation adjustments
- Supplier bank account changes

---

### 2.2 Default Risk Classification

**When in doubt, classify as higher risk.**

If a capability's risk is ambiguous between two classes, assign the **higher risk class** until proven otherwise through:
- Historical performance data (≥6 months)
- Low override rate (<5%)
- Executive consensus

- **Baseline:** <5% override rate (healthy autonomy)
- **Warning:** Override rate 5-10%
- **Critical:** Override rate >10%

**Action:**
- Warning: Investigate override reasons, tune logic
- Critical: Downgrade to Level 1 (recommendation only), revise decision model

**Frequency:** Measured weekly, reviewed monthly

---

#### Monitor 4: Business Impact Deviation

**Metric:** Autonomous actions producing worse outcomes than manual baseline

**Threshold:**
- **Warning:** Outcome 5-10% worse than baseline (e.g., higher stockout rate)
- **Critical:** Outcome >10% worse than baseline

**Action:**
- Warning: Enhanced monitoring, investigate contributing factors
- Critical: Immediate autonomy suspension, revert to manual control

**Frequency:** Measured weekly, reviewed monthly

---

#### Monitor 5: Cascade Effect Detection

**Metric:** Autonomous action in one domain triggering unintended consequences in another

**Threshold:**
- **Warning:** Cross-domain impact detected (e.g., auto-reorder causes cash flow alert)
- **Critical:** Cross-domain cascade causing business disruption

**Action:**
- Warning: Review cross-domain dependencies, implement additional safeguards
- Critical: Suspend all cross-domain autonomy, require explicit authorization

**Frequency:** Real-time monitoring via Phase 2.0 control loop correlation

---

### 7.2 Automatic Downgrade Triggers

Autonomy must be **automatically downgraded** (no human approval required) when:

| Trigger Condition | Downgrade Action | Recovery Process |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Accuracy drops >10%** | Level 3 → Level 2 or Level 2 → Level 1 | 90-day performance recovery + executive reapproval |
| **Error rate >5% over 7 days** | Immediate suspension (Level 0) | Root cause fix + 30-day pilot + executive reapproval |
| **Override rate >10%** | Level 3 → Level 1 | Logic revision + 90-day testing + executive reapproval |
| **Business outcome >10% worse** | Immediate suspension (Level 0) | Manual control indefinitely, autonomy requires new business case |
| **Cascade effect detected** | Suspend all affected domains | Cross-domain risk assessment + explicit reapproval |
| **Audit trail failure** | Immediate suspension (system-wide) | Audit system restoration + executive + auditor sign-off |

**Downgrade authority:** System automatic OR Domain Owner OR CTO (any can trigger)

**Recovery:** Autonomy cannot be re-enabled until performance recovery is proven and executive reapproval granted

---

### 7.3 Quarterly Risk Review

Every quarter, conduct **formal risk review** for all active autonomous capabilities:

**Review Agenda:**
1. **Performance Assessment:** Did autonomy meet accuracy, override, and outcome targets?
2. **Failure Analysis:** What errors occurred? Root causes? Recurrence prevention?
3. **Risk Reclassification:** Has risk profile changed? (e.g., new regulations, business model shift)
4. **Safeguard Effectiveness:** Are guardrails working? Adjustments needed?
5. **Expansion or Downgrade:** Graduate to higher tier, maintain, or downgrade?

**Review Participants:** CTO, COO, CFO, Chief Risk Officer, Domain Owners, Internal Audit

**Outputs:**
- Updated autonomy registry (current status of all capabilities)
- Risk reclassifications (if business context changed)
- Downgrade decisions (capabilities no longer meeting criteria)
- Expansion approvals (capabilities ready for higher tier)

**Board Reporting:** Summary report to Board Audit Committee quarterly

---

## SECTION 8: INCIDENT RESPONSE FOR AUTONOMOUS FAILURE

**No autonomous capability may operate without all 5 owners identified.**

---

### 9.2 Accountability for Autonomous Failures

When an autonomous failure occurs:

**Executive Owner:** Accountable to board/CEO for business impact and recovery
**Domain Owner:** Accountable for oversight failure and process improvement
**Technical Owner:** Accountable for logic failure and technical remediation
**Risk Owner:** Accountable for risk assessment accuracy and safeguard adequacy
**Audit Owner:** Accountable for audit trail integrity and compliance verification

**Accountability is not punishment.** It is clear assignment of responsibility for investigation, remediation, and prevention.

---

---

## SECTION 10: REVIEW & EVOLUTION PROCESS

### 10.1 Quarterly Autonomy Risk Review

**Review Scope:** All active autonomous capabilities across all domains

**Review Components:**

#### 1. Performance Assessment

**For each capability, measure:**
- **Accuracy:** Actual vs baseline performance
- **Override Rate:** % of actions overridden by humans
- **Incident Count:** Minor, Moderate, Major, Critical incidents
- **Business Impact:** Quantified benefit or harm

**Outcome:** Maintain, downgrade, or graduate to higher tier

---

#### 2. Capability Graduation (Tier Advancement)

**Candidates for graduation:**
- Capabilities currently at Level 1 or 2 that meet Level 3 criteria
- Capabilities currently at Level 3 that meet Level 4 criteria

**Graduation Requirements:**
- All performance criteria met for minimum period (12-24 months)
- Zero Major or Critical incidents in past 12 months
- Executive sponsor supports graduation
- Enhanced safeguards designed for higher tier

**Approval:** Autonomy Governance Council + required executives per risk level

---

#### 3. Capability Demotion (Tier Downgrade)

**Candidates for demotion:**
- Capabilities with accuracy <95% baseline
- Capabilities with override rate >10%
- Capabilities with 2+ Moderate incidents or any Major/Critical incident
- Capabilities where business context changed (new regulations, business model shift)

**Demotion Decision:** Domain Owner recommends, Autonomy Governance Council approves

**Post-Demotion:** Capability must meet criteria again before re-graduation considered

---

#### 4. Risk Reclassification

**Triggers for reclassification:**
- New regulations affecting compliance risk
- Business model changes affecting financial impact
- Technology changes affecting cascade risk
- Historical failure patterns indicating higher risk than originally assessed

**Process:**
- Chief Risk Officer proposes reclassification
- CTO + Domain Owner review and concur/dissent
- Autonomy Governance Council approves
- If reclassified to higher risk: autonomy tier may be automatically downgraded

---

### 10.2 Documentation Update Cadence

**Autonomy Registry:** Updated within 24 hours of any change

**Risk Assessment Matrix (this document):** Reviewed and updated quarterly

**Autonomy Policies (Phase 3.0):** Reviewed annually, updated as needed

**Board Reporting:** Quarterly summary of autonomy status, incidents, and changes

---

### 10.3 Board Visibility Requirements

**Quarterly Board Report includes:**
1. **Autonomy Inventory:** List of all active autonomous capabilities by tier and risk level
2. **Performance Summary:** Aggregate accuracy, override rate, incident count
3. **Incident Summary:** All Major and Critical incidents, root causes, resolutions
4. **Risk Changes:** Capabilities reclassified or downgraded due to risk
5. **Business Impact:** Quantified efficiency gains or losses from autonomy
6. **Forward Plan:** Capabilities under consideration for graduation or new activation

**Board Approval Required:**
- Any Critical Risk (🔴) capability activation
- Any autonomy incident affecting >$500K or regulatory compliance
- Material changes to autonomy policies or risk framework

---

### 10.4 Continuous Improvement Process

**Learning from Failures:**
- All autonomy incidents feed into quarterly review
- Root cause patterns analyzed across domains
- Safeguard effectiveness evaluated
- Risk assessment methodology refined

**Learning from Successes:**
- High-performing autonomous capabilities studied
- Best practices extracted and documented
- Successful patterns applied to new autonomy proposals

**Evolution Principles:**
- Autonomy scope expands gradually (add 1-2 capabilities per quarter, not 10)
- Risk tolerance remains conservative (err on side of manual control)
- Governance keeps pace with autonomy (policies updated before new activations)
- Trust is earned slowly and can be lost quickly (downgrade fast, graduate slow)

---

## ENFORCEMENT & ACCOUNTABILITY

### Autonomy Risk Committee

A standing **Autonomy Risk Committee** (subset of Autonomy Governance Council) meets monthly to:

- Review risk monitoring dashboards
- Investigate override patterns
- Approve conditional autonomy escalations
- Recommend downgrades to Governance Council

**Members:** Chief Risk Officer (chair), CTO, VP Operations, Head of Internal Audit

---

### Compliance & Audit

**Internal Audit:**
- Quarterly audit of autonomy registry (completeness, accuracy)
- Annual audit of autonomy safeguards (are they operational?)
- Incident response audit (were protocols followed?)

**External Audit:**
- Informed of all Critical Risk autonomy activations
- Provided read-only access to autonomy audit trail
- Consulted on financial autonomy (Level 2+ for financial capabilities)

---

### Metrics Reporting

The following metrics are reported to executives **monthly** and board **quarterly**:

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Active Autonomy Count** | How many capabilities are autonomous? (by tier) |
| **Risk Distribution** | How many 🟢🟡🟠🔴 capabilities? |
| **Performance Accuracy** | Average accuracy across all autonomous capabilities |
| **Override Rate** | % of autonomous actions overridden |
| **Incident Count** | Minor, Moderate, Major, Critical incidents |
| **Downgrade Events** | How many capabilities were downgraded? (trend) |
| **Business Impact** | Quantified efficiency gain or cost savings |

These metrics indicate autonomy health and enterprise risk exposure.

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Autonomy is powerful. It accelerates decisions, improves consistency, and enables scale.

But autonomy is also dangerous. It amplifies errors, erodes governance silently, and can destroy trust in days what took years to build.

**The difference between powerful and dangerous is governance.**

This risk assessment matrix exists to ensure that:
- Every autonomous action has been evaluated for risk
- Every capability has explicit safeguards
- Every failure has clear accountability
- Every escalation has a path to resolution

Autonomy without accountability is just **delegation of blame** when things go wrong.

Autonomy without monitoring is just **willful blindness** to accumulating risk.

Autonomy without rollback is just **commitment to failure propagation**.

This framework ensures that **every autonomous action carries a human accountability.**

When the system acts, a human has authorized it. When the system fails, a human is accountable for recovery. When the system improves, a human has validated the improvement.

**Every autonomous action carries a human accountability.**
