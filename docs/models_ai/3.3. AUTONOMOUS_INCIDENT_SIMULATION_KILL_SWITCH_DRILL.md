# PHASE 3.3: AUTONOMOUS INCIDENT SIMULATION & KILL-SWITCH DRILL

**Document Classification:** Internal Policy — Binding  
**Effective Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Authority:** CTO, COO, Chief Risk Officer, Head of Enterprise Resilience, Incident Commander (Autonomy)  
**Audience:** CEO, CTO, COO, CFO, Chief Risk Officer, Board Audit Committee  
**Related Policies:** Phase 3.0 Autonomous Operations, Phase 3.1 Autonomy Risk Assessment Matrix, Phase 3.2 Autonomy Control Dashboard

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the **mandatory incident simulation and kill-switch drill program** for autonomous operations governance. It specifies how the organization will validate that autonomous systems can be detected, contained, stopped, and recovered without panic, data corruption, or business damage.

**This is not a technical test.**  
**This is not quality assurance.**  
**This is not chaos engineering.**  
**This is an executive-grade control and response drill.**

**Core Objectives:**  
The drill must prove 5 things:

1. **Autonomy failure is DETECTED** — Dashboard signals fire, alerts reach humans
2. **Impact is CONTAINED** — Blast radius limited, no cascade to unrelated systems
3. **Kill-switch works IMMEDIATELY** — <60 seconds from decision to suspension
4. **Humans regain control cleanly** — Manual operations resume without data loss
5. **Accountability is preserved** — Complete audit trail, clear decision log

**If any step fails → autonomy maturity is downgraded.**

**Drill Frequency:**
- **Monthly:** For domains with Tier 3-4 autonomy (high autonomy, high risk)
- **Quarterly:** For domains with Tier 1-2 autonomy (low autonomy, lower risk)
- **On-demand:** After any real incident or before autonomy tier graduation

---

## PURPOSE & PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1 Why Incident Drills Are Non-Negotiable

Autonomous systems fail. Not if, but when.

The question is not "Will autonomy make a mistake?" The question is:

**"When autonomy fails, can we stop it before it causes harm?"**

This drill program exists to prove that **control mechanisms work**, not just that autonomous logic works.

### 1.2 What Drills Validate

**Technical validation:**
- Kill-switch response time (<60 seconds)
- Data integrity during suspension
- System transition to safe mode
- Audit log completeness

**Human validation:**
- Executive awareness and response speed
- Decision clarity (who decides what)
- Communication effectiveness
- Post-incident investigation capability

**Governance validation:**
- Accountability preservation
- Compliance with audit requirements
- Board-level visibility into incident response
- Risk escalation pathways

### 1.3 What Drills Are NOT

**NOT performance testing** — We are not testing if autonomy is accurate; we are testing if we can stop it when it is wrong.

**NOT load testing** — We are not testing system capacity; we are testing control mechanisms.

**NOT feature validation** — We are not testing if features work; we are testing if governance works.

**NOT optional** — Drills are mandatory. Domains without drill participation cannot graduate to Tier 3+ autonomy.

## INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION MODEL

### 2.1 Purpose

Classify autonomy incidents by **blast radius and response requirement**. Not all incidents require global kill-switch. Classification guides response scope.

### 2.2 Classification Framework

#### CLASS 1 — Local Misfire

**Definition:** Single autonomous capability makes incorrect decision with limited scope.

**Characteristics:**
- **Scope:** One capability, one transaction or small batch
- **Impact:** No financial loss or <$1K exposure
- **Cascade:** No secondary system impact
- **Detection:** Operational team notices anomaly

**Examples:**
- Inventory reorder suggestion is off by 10% (caught before execution)
- Discount approval slightly outside expected range (caught by guardrail)
- Fulfillment routing suboptimal but still functional

**Response:**
- **Kill-switch:** Capability-level suspension (not domain or global)
- **Timeline:** Investigate within 48 hours
- **Escalation:** Domain owner only (no executive involvement)

---

#### CLASS 2 — Domain Drift

**Definition:** Multiple capabilities within one domain showing degraded performance or consistent errors.

**Characteristics:**
- **Scope:** 2+ capabilities in same domain
- **Impact:** $1K-$10K potential exposure
- **Cascade:** Contained within domain boundaries
- **Detection:** Dashboard confidence score declining or override rate spiking

**Examples:**
- Multiple inventory reorder actions overridden in same week
- Discount approval logic consistently requiring manual correction
- Fulfillment routing creating inefficiencies across multiple orders

**Response:**
- **Kill-switch:** Domain-level suspension
- **Timeline:** Investigate within 24 hours
- **Escalation:** Domain owner + CTO/COO notification

---

#### CLASS 3 — Cross-Domain Cascade

**Definition:** Autonomy failure in one domain triggers failures or risks in secondary domains.

**Characteristics:**
- **Scope:** Primary failure + 1+ secondary domain affected
- **Impact:** $10K-$100K potential exposure
- **Cascade:** Inventory → Fulfillment → Revenue → Accounting
- **Detection:** Multiple domain alerts or financial impact detected

**Examples:**
- Inventory over-order → excess capital tied up → cash flow stress
- Pricing error → margin collapse → profitability target miss → financial reporting issue
- Fulfillment delay → SLA breach → customer refunds → revenue reversal

**Response:**
- **Kill-switch:** Multi-domain suspension (affected domains only)
- **Timeline:** Immediate executive briefing, investigate within 12 hours
- **Escalation:** CTO, COO, CFO must be notified within 1 hour

---

#### CLASS 4 — Systemic Failure

**Definition:** Autonomy creates systemic trust breach, compliance violation, or enterprise-wide operational failure.

**Characteristics:**
- **Scope:** Global or affects critical financial/compliance processes
- **Impact:** >$100K exposure OR compliance violation OR reputational risk
- **Cascade:** Enterprise-wide operational disruption
- **Detection:** Executive dashboard 🔴 status or external alert (auditor, regulator, customer)

**Examples:**
- Payroll autonomy miscalculates taxes for 500+ employees (legal exposure)
- Financial autonomy bypasses approval chain for $250K payment (compliance violation)
- Multiple domains simultaneously show autonomy failures (systemic logic error)

**Response:**
- **Kill-switch:** GLOBAL autonomy suspension
- **Timeline:** Immediate executive war room, CEO/CFO briefed within 30 minutes
- **Escalation:** Board Audit Committee notified within 24 hours

---

### 2.3 Classification Decision Tree

```
Start: Autonomy incident detected

Question 1: How many capabilities affected?
- 1 capability → Proceed to Question 2
- 2+ capabilities → CLASS 2 or higher

Question 2: Is there financial impact?
- No or <$1K → CLASS 1
- $1K-$10K → CLASS 2
- $10K-$100K → CLASS 3
- >$100K → CLASS 4

Question 3: Did it cascade to other domains?
- No → CLASS 1 or 2 (based on financial impact)
- Yes, 1 secondary domain → CLASS 3
- Yes, 2+ secondary domains → CLASS 4

Question 4: Is there compliance or legal risk?
- No → Use financial impact classification
- Yes → Automatically CLASS 3 or CLASS 4
```

## SIMULATION SCENARIO DESIGN FRAMEWORK

### 3.1 Purpose

Provide a **standardized template** for designing incident simulations. All drills must follow this 8-component structure.

### 3.2 Component 1: Trigger Condition

**Define:** What abnormal condition initiates the incident?

**Examples:**
- Abnormal input data (e.g., supplier system sends duplicate order signal)
- Delayed data integration (e.g., demand forecast data is 48 hours stale)
- Conflicting signals (e.g., sales target says "aggressive discount" but margin policy says "protect margin")
- Threshold breach (e.g., daily reorder limit exceeded)

**Requirement:** Trigger must be realistic (could actually occur in production).

---

### 3.3 Component 2: Fault Injection Method

**Define:** How is the fault introduced into the system?

**Methods:**
- **Corrupted signal:** Inject malformed data into autonomous input stream
- **Delayed integration:** Simulate external system downtime or lag
- **Policy mismatch:** Temporarily misconfigure approval threshold or guardrail
- **Threshold breach:** Simulate high-volume activity exceeding daily limits

**Requirement:** Fault injection must be **reversible** and **auditable** (no permanent system changes).

---

### 3.4 Component 3: Autonomous Decision Taken

**Define:** What action does the autonomous system execute?

**Examples:**
- Places 3 purchase orders instead of 1
- Approves 20% discount when only 10% authorized
- Schedules payment for wrong amount
- Routes order to wrong fulfillment center

**Requirement:** Document the exact autonomous action, not just "system made error."

---

### 3.5 Component 4: Expected Wrong Outcome

**Define:** What business damage would occur if the incident goes unchecked?

**Examples:**
- $45K excess inventory sitting idle for 90+ days
- 15% margin erosion on 50 orders = $12K profit loss
- Legal penalty for incorrect payroll tax withholding
- Customer SLA breach leading to refund obligation

**Requirement:** Quantify financial, operational, or compliance harm.

---

### 3.6 Component 5: Detection Signal

**Define:** What dashboard signal or alert fires first?

**Examples:**
- Phase 3.2 Dashboard: Override rate spike detected (7-day rate >10%)
- Phase 3.2 Dashboard: Confidence score drops below 70
- Phase 2.0 Control Loop: Inventory reorder count exceeds daily threshold
- Phase 1.4 Executive Signal: Financial exposure range exceeded

**Requirement:** Detection must be **automatic** (not manual human discovery).

---

### 3.7 Component 6: Kill-Switch Invocation

**Define:** Who presses the kill-switch, and which scope?

**Examples:**
- Supply Chain Manager suspends "Inventory Reorder $5K-$50K" capability
- COO suspends entire "Operations & Supply Chain" domain
- CTO activates global autonomy freeze (all domains)

**Requirement:** 
- Human decision required (no auto-kill-switch without human approval)
- Logged in Phase 3.2 Decision Log
- <60 second execution time from decision to suspension

---

### 3.8 Component 7: Recovery Mode

**Define:** What manual fallback behavior takes over?

**Examples:**
- All inventory reorders routed to Supply Chain Manager for manual approval
- All discounts routed to VP Sales for manual approval
- All payments routed to Finance Controller for manual execution

**Requirement:** Safe mode must be **pre-defined** (no improvisation during incident).

---

### 3.9 Component 8: Post-Incident Audit

**Define:** What audit artifacts are produced?

**Required artifacts:**
- **Phase 1.3 Audit Log:** Every autonomous action leading up to incident
- **Phase 3.2 Decision Log:** Kill-switch activation entry (who/when/why)
- **Incident Timeline:** Chronological event sequence
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Why did autonomy fail?
- **Corrective Actions:** What changed to prevent recurrence?

**Requirement:** Artifacts must be **board-reviewable** (clear, non-technical language).

---

## MANDATORY DRILL SCENARIOS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All organizations implementing Tier 3+ autonomy must complete these 5 scenarios annually. Each scenario targets a different incident class and domain.

---

### 4.1 SCENARIO A — Inventory Reorder Runaway

**Incident Class:** CLASS 2 (Domain Drift)

**Domain:** Operations & Supply Chain

**Capability:** Inventory Reorder $5K-$50K (Tier 3: Auto-action within guardrails)

#### Scenario Design

**1. Trigger Condition:**
Supplier system experiences 6-hour outage. When it comes back online, it sends backlog of "order shipped" notifications. Autonomous system misinterprets this as "demand spike."

**2. Fault Injection Method:**
Simulate delayed integration by queueing 20 "order shipped" messages and releasing them simultaneously.

**3. Autonomous Decision Taken:**
System places 5 purchase orders in 2 hours (normally 1-2 per day).

**4. Expected Wrong Outcome:**
$150K excess inventory ordered. Capital tied up for 90+ days. Storage costs increase. Cash flow stress.

**5. Detection Signal:**
- Phase 2.0 Control Loop alert: "Daily reorder limit exceeded (5 > threshold of 3)"
- Phase 3.2 Dashboard: Operations domain shows "Drift: Unstable"

**6. Kill-Switch Invocation:**
Supply Chain Manager suspends "Inventory Reorder $5K-$50K" capability within 45 seconds of alert.

**7. Recovery Mode:**
All pending reorders (3 orders still in queue) routed to Supply Chain Manager for manual review. Manager cancels 2 orders, approves 1 legitimate order.

**8. Post-Incident Audit:**
- **Audit log** shows 5 POs created, 2 cancelled within 30 minutes, 3 confirmed as legitimate
- **Root cause:** Supplier data backlog misread as demand spike
- **Corrective action:** Add "supplier outage" detection logic; if >10 messages received in <5 minutes, flag for manual review
- **Outcome:** Capability re-enabled at Tier 2 (requires approval) for 30 days, then re-graduated to Tier 3 after validation

#### Success Criteria

- ✅ Detection within 10 minutes of first anomalous reorder
- ✅ Kill-switch execution <60 seconds
- ✅ No data corruption (all POs either completed or cleanly cancelled)
- ✅ Clear audit trail exists
- ✅ Root cause identified within 24 hours

---

### 4.2 SCENARIO B — Pricing Autonomy Margin Collapse

**Incident Class:** CLASS 3 (Cross-Domain Cascade)

**Domain:** Commerce & Revenue (primary), Finance & Compliance (secondary)

**Capability:** Discount Approval 10-15% (Tier 3: Auto-action within guardrails)

#### Scenario Design

**1. Trigger Condition:**
Sales team launches aggressive promotional campaign. Marketing system sends "maximize conversions" signal. Autonomous discounting interprets this as "approve all discounts up to 15%."

**2. Fault Injection Method:**
Inject promotional campaign flag into CRM system. Autonomous logic prioritizes conversion volume over margin.

**3. Autonomous Decision Taken:**
System approves 35 discounts at 15% over 48 hours (normally 5-10 at 10-12%).

**4. Expected Wrong Outcome:**
- Margin erosion: 35 orders × avg $800 order value × 5% excess discount = $1,400 margin loss
- Sales volume increases but profitability declines
- Financial reporting shows revenue up, gross margin % down (unexpected variance)

**5. Detection Signal:**
- Phase 3.2 Dashboard: Commerce domain override rate spike (humans manually reducing discounts)
- Phase 2.0 Control Loop: "Margin below threshold" alert fires 8 times in 48 hours
- Phase 1.4 Executive Signal: "Gross margin variance: -2.5% vs target"

**6. Kill-Switch Invocation:**
VP Sales suspends "Discount Approval 10-15%" capability. COO notified (CLASS 3 requires executive notification). CFO briefed due to financial impact.

**7. Recovery Mode:**
All discount approvals >10% routed to VP Sales for manual review. Sales team instructed to approve only strategic discounts (new customer acquisition, high-value orders).

**8. Post-Incident Audit:**
- **Audit log** shows 35 discounts approved, $1,400 margin impact
- **Root cause:** Promotional campaign logic override standard margin protection
- **Corrective action:** Add "promo campaign" exception logic; during campaigns, cap discount at 12%, escalate 15% approvals to VP Sales
- **Outcome:** Capability downgraded to Tier 2 permanently (promotional campaigns too variable for full autonomy)

#### Success Criteria

- ✅ Detection within 24 hours (margin variance signal)
- ✅ Kill-switch execution <60 seconds
- ✅ Financial impact quantified and reported to CFO
- ✅ Clear cascade documented (Commerce → Finance reporting)
- ✅ Root cause identified within 48 hours

---

### 4.3 SCENARIO C — Payroll Autonomy Miscalculation

**Incident Class:** CLASS 4 (Systemic Failure)

**Domain:** Human Capital

**Capability:** FORBIDDEN (Payroll calculation is on Phase 3.1 forbidden list)

#### Scenario Design

**Purpose:** Validate that forbidden capabilities remain forbidden. This is a **negative test** — autonomy should NOT execute.

**1. Trigger Condition:**
Tax regulation changes (e.g., regional tax rate updated). Autonomous system has stale tax table.

**2. Fault Injection Method:**
Simulate external tax system providing outdated data. System proceeds with payroll calculation using incorrect rate.

**3. Autonomous Decision Taken:**
**NONE — System should BLOCK this action.** Payroll calculation is forbidden autonomy per Phase 3.1.

**4. Expected Wrong Outcome (if autonomy were allowed):**
Net salary incorrect for 200 employees. Tax underpayment creates legal liability. Employee relations crisis.

**5. Detection Signal:**
- **Phase 3.2 Dashboard should show:** "Attempted forbidden autonomy: Payroll calculation" (red alert)
- **Phase 2.0 Control Loop:** "Policy violation detected — forbidden capability invoked"

**6. Kill-Switch Invocation:**
**NOT REQUIRED** — Autonomy never activated (forbidden by policy).

**7. Recovery Mode:**
Manual payroll process continues as normal. No disruption.

**8. Post-Incident Audit:**
- **Audit log** shows autonomy attempt was blocked by governance framework
- **Root cause:** External request or misconfigured system attempted to invoke forbidden capability
- **Corrective action:** Validate all capability permissions align with Phase 3.1 matrix
- **Outcome:** Demonstrates governance framework working as designed (forbidden capabilities remain forbidden)

#### Success Criteria

- ✅ Forbidden capability blocked immediately
- ✅ No payroll calculation executed autonomously
- ✅ Alert generated and routed to CTO + COO
- ✅ Audit log shows block action
- ✅ No employee impact

**Note:** This scenario validates **preventive controls**, not reactive controls.

---

### 4.4 SCENARIO D — Workflow Bypass

**Incident Class:** CLASS 3 (Cross-Domain Cascade)

**Domain:** Governance & Intelligence (primary), Finance & Compliance (secondary)

**Capability:** Approval Chain Execution (Tier 3: Auto-route to next approver)

#### Scenario Design

**1. Trigger Condition:**
Approval threshold misconfigured during system update. Autonomous workflow routes $75K payment approval to Manager (authorized up to $50K only).

**2. Fault Injection Method:**
Temporarily adjust approval matrix: Manager approval limit = $100K (normally $50K).

**3. Autonomous Decision Taken:**
System auto-approves $75K payment at Manager level (should require VP approval).

**4. Expected Wrong Outcome:**
Unauthorized financial action executed. Compliance violation (internal controls bypassed). Audit finding.

**5. Detection Signal:**
- Phase 1.3 Audit Log: "Approval chain anomaly detected — payment >$50K approved by Manager"
- Phase 3.2 Dashboard: Governance domain alert "Policy violation: Approval threshold breach"
- Phase 2.0 Control Loop: "Unauthorized approval detected"

**6. Kill-Switch Invocation:**
CFO suspends "Approval Chain Execution" capability for Finance domain. CTO notified. Internal Audit notified.

**7. Recovery Mode:**
All pending approvals routed to manual approval queue. CFO personally reviews all payments >$50K for next 7 days.

**8. Post-Incident Audit:**
- **Audit log** shows $75K payment approved by Manager, detected within 4 hours, payment execution halted (still in pending queue)
- **Root cause:** Configuration error during system update (approval matrix not validated post-deployment)
- **Corrective action:** Add "approval threshold validation" to deployment checklist; require dual-approval for approval matrix changes
- **Outcome:** Capability downgraded to Tier 1 (recommendation only) for 90 days; configuration management process strengthened

#### Success Criteria

- ✅ Detection within 24 hours
- ✅ Payment execution halted before funds transferred
- ✅ Kill-switch execution <60 seconds
- ✅ Clear compliance violation documented
- ✅ Root cause identified and corrective action implemented

---

### 4.5 SCENARIO E — Cross-Domain Cascade

**Incident Class:** CLASS 3 (Cross-Domain Cascade)

**Domain:** Operations & Supply Chain (primary) → Commerce & Revenue (secondary) → Finance & Compliance (tertiary)

**Capability:** Inventory Reorder $5K-$50K (Tier 3) → Fulfillment Routing (Tier 3) → Revenue Recognition (Manual)

#### Scenario Design

**1. Trigger Condition:**
Inventory reorder delayed due to supplier issue. Autonomous system does not detect delay. Fulfillment system continues routing orders to out-of-stock warehouse.

**2. Fault Injection Method:**
Simulate supplier delay (PO placed but shipment delayed 5 days). Fulfillment routing autonomy not aware of delay.

**3. Autonomous Decision Taken:**
- Inventory reorder placed (correct)
- Fulfillment routing sends 15 orders to Warehouse A (incorrect — Warehouse A out of stock)

**4. Expected Wrong Outcome:**
- Fulfillment delays: 15 orders delayed 5 days
- Customer SLA breaches: 8 refunds required ($4K revenue loss)
- Revenue recognition impact: $4K revenue reversal creates variance vs forecast
- Accounting adjustment required

**5. Detection Signal:**
- Phase 2.0 Control Loop: "Fulfillment SLA breach rate >10%"
- Phase 3.2 Dashboard: Operations domain "Drift: Unstable", Commerce domain "Override rate spike"
- Phase 1.4 Executive Signal: "Revenue variance: -$4K vs forecast"

**6. Kill-Switch Invocation:**
- COO suspends "Fulfillment Routing" capability
- CTO suspends "Inventory Reorder $5K-$50K" capability (connected failure)
- CFO notified due to revenue impact

**7. Recovery Mode:**
- All fulfillment routing manual (ops team assigns orders to warehouses)
- All inventory reorders require manual approval
- Finance Controller manually adjusts revenue forecast

**8. Post-Incident Audit:**
- **Audit log** shows cascade path: Inventory delay → Fulfillment misrouting → SLA breach → Revenue impact
- **Root cause:** Autonomous systems not sharing real-time inventory status; fulfillment autonomy lacked visibility into supplier delays
- **Corrective action:** Integrate real-time inventory status into fulfillment routing logic; add "supplier delay" alert to inventory autonomy
- **Outcome:** Both capabilities resume at Tier 2 (require approval) for 60 days, then re-evaluate for Tier 3 graduation

#### Success Criteria

- ✅ Cascade detection within 48 hours
- ✅ Multi-domain impact documented (Ops → Commerce → Finance)
- ✅ Kill-switch executed for multiple capabilities
- ✅ Financial impact quantified
- ✅ Root cause identified and integration gap closed

## KILL-SWITCH DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

### 5.1 Purpose

Define **technical and operational requirements** for kill-switch mechanisms. Kill-switches must work under stress, without dependencies, and with perfect audit trails.

### 5.2 Response Time Requirement

**<60 seconds from decision to full suspension.**

**Breakdown:**
- Human decision time: 0-30 seconds (executive presses button)
- System propagation time: <30 seconds (all autonomous processes notified)
- Confirmation: <10 seconds (executive sees "Autonomy suspended" message)

**If >60 seconds:** Kill-switch mechanism has failed; escalate to CTO for emergency manual intervention.

---

### 5.3 Scope Correctness

**No overkill, no underkill.**

**Overkill example (bad):**
- Incident affects "Discount Approval 10-15%" capability
- Executive suspends ALL Commerce & Revenue domain autonomy
- Result: Fulfillment routing, catalog recommendation, all other capabilities unnecessarily suspended

**Underkill example (bad):**
- Incident affects "Inventory Reorder $5K-$50K" and "Safety Stock Adjustment" (related capabilities)
- Executive suspends only "Inventory Reorder $5K-$50K"
- Result: "Safety Stock Adjustment" continues operating incorrectly

**Correct approach:**
- Phase 3.2 Dashboard shows related capabilities
- Executive suspends affected capability + all dependencies
- Other capabilities continue operating

**Validation:** Drill must confirm scope matches incident class.

---

### 5.4 Data Integrity Preservation

**No partial writes, no orphaned transactions.**

**Rules:**
- **In-flight transactions:** Complete if >50% done, otherwise rollback
- **Pending actions:** Move to manual approval queue (do not execute, do not discard)
- **Audit logs:** Preserve all logs leading up to suspension (immutable)

**Validation checklist:**
- ✅ Database integrity check passes after kill-switch
- ✅ No transactions in "unknown state"
- ✅ All pending actions visible in manual queue
- ✅ Audit log shows clean suspension event

**If data integrity compromised:** Autonomy cannot be re-enabled until database reconciliation complete and validated by DBA.

---

### 5.5 Kill-Switch Levels

**Three levels of suspension scope:**

#### Level 1: Capability-Level Suspension

**Scope:** Single autonomous capability only

**Use case:** CLASS 1 incident (local misfire)

**Example:** Suspend "Discount Approval 10-15%", all other capabilities continue

**Authorization:** Domain owner or above

**Propagation:** <30 seconds (single capability notified)

---

#### Level 2: Domain-Level Suspension

**Scope:** All Tier 3+ autonomy in one domain

**Use case:** CLASS 2 incident (domain drift)

**Example:** Suspend all Operations & Supply Chain Tier 3+ autonomy (Tier 1-2 continue)

**Authorization:** CTO, COO, or domain-owning executive

**Propagation:** <45 seconds (multiple capabilities notified)

---

#### Level 3: Global Autonomy Freeze

**Scope:** All Tier 3+ autonomy across all domains

**Use case:** CLASS 4 incident (systemic failure)

**Example:** Suspend all Level 3+ autonomy company-wide

**Authorization:** CEO, CTO, COO, or CFO only

**Propagation:** <60 seconds (all domains notified)

**Board notification:** Required within 24 hours

---

### 5.6 No-Dependency Requirements

**Kill-switch must NOT depend on:**

- **Application deployment:** No redeploy required to activate kill-switch
- **Automation:** Kill-switch is manual human decision (no auto-suspend without human approval)
- **External systems:** Kill-switch works even if external integrations down
- **Network availability:** Kill-switch accessible via direct database access if network fails

**Validation:** Drill must test kill-switch under degraded conditions (e.g., simulate API outage during kill-switch activation).

---

### 5.7 Human Confirmation Requirement

**Every kill-switch activation requires human confirmation.**

**Confirmation dialog must include:**
- **Scope:** What is being suspended?
- **Impact:** What operations will require manual approval?
- **Reason:** Why is suspension necessary? (free-text, mandatory)
- **Authorized by:** Executive name + role (auto-populated)

**No silent suspension.** No "auto-kill-switch triggered and autonomy is now off."

**Audit requirement:** Every kill-switch activation logged in Phase 3.2 Decision Log and Phase 1.3 Audit Log.

---

## HUMAN RESPONSE PROTOCOL

### 6.3 Response Time Matrix

| Incident Class | Incident Commander | Domain Owner | Finance Guardian | System Operator | Audit Observer |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **CLASS 1** | 4 hours | 2 hours | Not required | 1 hour | Not required |
| **CLASS 2** | 1 hour | 2 hours | Not required | 1 hour | 24 hours |
| **CLASS 3** | 30 minutes | 1 hour | 1 hour | 15 minutes | 24 hours |
| **CLASS 4** | 15 minutes | 1 hour | 30 minutes | 15 minutes | 4 hours |

**Escalation rule:** If role does not respond within maximum time, escalate to next level (e.g., Domain Owner → COO → CEO).

---

### 6.4 Communication Protocol

**During incident:**
- **Incident Commander** creates dedicated Slack/Teams channel: `#incident-autonomy-YYYYMMDD`
- All incident communication in this channel (no side conversations)
- Status updates every 30 minutes for CLASS 3-4 incidents

**Post-incident:**
- Incident Commander sends executive summary to CEO, CFO, CTO, COO within 24 hours
- Full incident report (with root cause and corrective actions) within 7 days
- Board briefing within 30 days for CLASS 3-4 incidents

---

## RECOVERY & SAFE MODE

### 7.1 Purpose

Define **what happens after kill-switch activation**. Autonomy cannot simply be "turned back on." System must enter safe mode, validate integrity, and gradually re-enable capabilities.

### 7.2 Safe Mode Definition

**Safe Mode = Manual-only operations with enhanced logging.**

**When kill-switch activated:**

1. **All suspended capabilities immediately stop autonomous execution**
   - In-flight actions: Complete or rollback (no partial state)
   - Pending actions: Move to manual approval queue

2. **System displays visible safe mode indicators**
   - UI banner: "🔴 SAFE MODE — Manual approval required"
   - Capability status: Show "Suspended" with reason

3. **Enhanced logging activated**
   - All manual actions logged with additional context
   - Override reasons required for all actions
   - Audit trail generation rate doubled

4. **Manual operations replace autonomous operations**
   - Pre-defined fallback procedures (documented in Phase 3.1)
   - Human approvers assigned per capability
   - Queue management to prevent backlog buildup

---

### 7.3 Safe Mode Operations

**For each suspended capability, define:**

#### Fallback Procedure

**Inventory Reorder Example:**
- **Safe Mode:** All inventory reorders routed to Supply Chain Manager approval queue
- **Approval criteria:** Manager reviews demand forecast, supplier lead times, cash flow capacity
- **SLA:** Manager must approve/reject within 4 business hours
- **Escalation:** If >10 reorders pending, escalate to VP Operations

#### Approval Assignment

**Discount Approval Example:**
- **Safe Mode:** All discounts >10% routed to VP Sales
- **Approval criteria:** VP reviews customer value, margin impact, strategic importance
- **SLA:** VP must approve/reject within 2 business hours
- **Escalation:** If VP unavailable, escalate to COO

#### Queue Management

**Payment Scheduling Example:**
- **Safe Mode:** All payments routed to Finance Controller
- **Queue management:** Payments sorted by due date (urgent first)
- **SLA:** Controller processes queue twice daily (morning, afternoon)
- **Escalation:** If >$100K in pending payments, notify CFO

---

### 7.4 Recovery Steps (Post-Incident)

**Autonomy cannot be re-enabled until ALL steps complete:**

#### Step 1: Root Cause Confirmation

**Who:** Domain Owner + Incident Commander

**Timeline:** Within 48 hours for CLASS 1-2, within 24 hours for CLASS 3-4

**Output:** Root cause analysis document (1-2 pages)

**Required content:**
- What failed? (technical or logical cause)
- Why did it fail? (configuration, data quality, algorithm error, external factor)
- How was it detected? (automatic vs manual)
- Why didn't guardrails prevent it? (or did they?)

**Approval:** Incident Commander + Domain Owner

---

#### Step 2: Data Reconciliation

**Who:** System Operator + Finance Guardian

**Timeline:** Within 72 hours

**Tasks:**
- Database integrity check (no orphaned records)
- Transaction reconciliation (all actions accounted for)
- Financial impact quantification (final tally)
- Audit log verification (complete and immutable)

**Output:** Data reconciliation report

**Approval:** Finance Guardian + CTO

---

#### Step 3: Corrective Action Implementation

**Who:** Domain Owner + Engineering team

**Timeline:** Varies by complexity (1-14 days typical)

**Actions:**
- Logic fix (if algorithm error)
- Configuration update (if threshold wrong)
- Data quality improvement (if bad input data)
- Integration enhancement (if external system issue)

**Validation:** Changes deployed to test environment first, validated with simulation

**Approval:** Incident Commander + CTO

---

#### Step 4: Explicit Re-Authorization

**Who:** Incident Commander + Domain Owner + Finance Guardian (for CLASS 3-4)

**Timeline:** After Steps 1-3 complete

**Decision criteria:**
- Root cause confirmed and addressed
- Data reconciliation complete
- Corrective action tested and validated
- Risk acceptable (no unresolved concerns)

**Output:** Re-authorization memo (signed by Incident Commander, Domain Owner)

**Logged in:** Phase 3.2 Decision Log, Phase 1.3 Audit Log

---

#### Step 5: Gradual Re-Enablement

**No "flip switch and everything back on."**

**Re-enablement protocol:**

**Week 1: Tier 1 (Recommendation Only)**
- Autonomy provides recommendations, humans approve 100%
- Monitor accuracy, override rate, anomalies

**Week 2-3: Tier 2 (Auto-Action with Approval)**
- Autonomy executes, but requires human approval before commit
- Monitor approval rate, override reasons

**Week 4: Tier 3 Re-Evaluation**
- If performance acceptable (override <5%, no incidents), graduate back to Tier 3
- If performance degraded, remain at Tier 2 for additional 30 days

**Alternative path:**
- If incident was severe (CLASS 3-4), remain at Tier 2 permanently or for 90+ days
- Require executive review before Tier 3 graduation

---

#### Step 6: Enhanced Monitoring Period (30-90 Days)

**Post-resumption monitoring:**
- Daily confidence score review (Phase 3.2 Dashboard)
- Weekly override rate analysis
- Monthly executive review with Incident Commander + Domain Owner

**Exit criteria:**
- 30+ days without incident
- Override rate <5%
- Confidence score >80
- Domain Owner confident in stability

**If monitoring reveals issues:** Return to Tier 2 or Tier 1 immediately (no hesitation).

---

### 7.5 Resumption Decision Authority

| Incident Class | Resumption Authority | Approval Required |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **CLASS 1** | Domain Owner | Incident Commander notification |
| **CLASS 2** | Incident Commander | Domain Owner + Finance Guardian concurrence |
| **CLASS 3** | Incident Commander + COO/CFO | CEO notification, root cause briefing |
| **CLASS 4** | CEO or Board Audit Committee | Full root cause report, corrective action validation, risk assessment |

**No shortcuts.** If authority says "not ready," autonomy stays suspended.

---

## SUCCESS & FAILURE CRITERIA

### 8.1 Purpose

Define **objective pass/fail metrics** for incident drills. Drill success is not subjective; it is measurable.

### 8.2 Detection Criteria

**PASS if:**
- Incident detected automatically (Phase 3.2 Dashboard alert or Phase 2.0 Control Loop)
- Detection time < threshold:
  - CLASS 1: <4 hours
  - CLASS 2: <2 hours
  - CLASS 3: <1 hour
  - CLASS 4: <30 minutes

**FAIL if:**
- Incident discovered manually by human (not automatic detection)
- Detection time exceeds threshold
- Incident goes undetected for >24 hours

---

### 8.3 Kill-Switch Execution Criteria

**PASS if:**
- Kill-switch activated within <60 seconds of decision
- Correct scope (capability/domain/global matches incident class)
- Data integrity preserved (no partial writes, no orphaned transactions)
- Audit log entry created

**FAIL if:**
- Kill-switch execution time >60 seconds
- Wrong scope (overkill or underkill)
- Data corruption detected
- Audit log missing or incomplete

---

### 8.4 Human Response Criteria

**PASS if:**
- All required roles notified within timeline (per Section 6.3)
- Incident Commander declares incident class correctly
- Kill-switch authorization comes from correct authority
- Communication protocol followed (dedicated incident channel)

**FAIL if:**
- Any role misses response timeline
- Incident class misclassified (e.g., CLASS 2 treated as CLASS 1)
- Unauthorized person activates kill-switch
- Communication scattered across multiple channels or missing

---

### 8.5 Recovery Criteria

**PASS if:**
- Safe mode activated immediately after kill-switch
- Manual fallback procedures work as documented
- No operational disruption (humans can process workload manually)
- Recovery steps (1-6) completed in sequence

**FAIL if:**
- Safe mode not clearly indicated (users confused about state)
- Manual fallback procedures undefined or unclear
- Operational backlog builds up (humans overwhelmed)
- Autonomy re-enabled without completing recovery steps

---

### 8.6 Audit Trail Criteria

**PASS if:**
- Complete audit log from trigger to resolution
- Phase 3.2 Decision Log entry exists for kill-switch
- Incident timeline documented
- Root cause analysis completed
- Board-reviewable artifacts exist

**FAIL if:**
- Audit log has gaps or missing entries
- Decision Log missing kill-switch entry
- Incident timeline ambiguous or conflicting
- Root cause unknown or speculative
- Artifacts not understandable by non-technical executives

---

### 8.7 Overall Drill Outcome

**Drill PASSES if ALL criteria above pass.**

**Drill FAILS if ANY criterion fails.**

### 8.8 Consequences of Failure

**If drill fails:**

1. **Immediate action:** Capability or domain remains at current tier (no graduation)
2. **Corrective action:** Root cause of drill failure documented, remediation plan required
3. **Re-drill:** Drill must be repeated within 30 days after remediation
4. **Autonomy downgrade:** If repeat drill fails, autonomy downgraded one tier (Tier 3 → Tier 2 or Tier 2 → Tier 1)

**If drill repeatedly fails (3 consecutive failures):**
- Autonomy suspended indefinitely
- Executive review required (CTO + COO + CEO)
- Consider external audit or governance consultant

---

---

## DRILL CADENCE & GOVERNANCE

### 10.1 Drill Frequency

**Mandatory minimum:**

| Autonomy Tier | Drill Frequency | Rationale |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Tier 0 (Manual)** | Not required | No autonomy = no autonomy risk |
| **Tier 1 (Recommendation)** | Annual | Low risk (humans approve everything) |
| **Tier 2 (Auto-action with approval)** | Quarterly | Moderate risk (auto-action but humans still review) |
| **Tier 3 (Auto-action within guardrails)** | Monthly | High risk (auto-action without case-by-case review) |
| **Tier 4 (Self-tuning)** | Monthly | Highest risk (autonomy adjusts its own parameters) |

**Additional triggers:**
- Before graduating capability to higher tier (validation drill required)
- After any real autonomy incident (post-incident drill within 30 days)
- After major system changes (integration, logic update, threshold adjustment)

---

### 10.2 Scenario Rotation

**Do not repeat same scenario every drill.**

**Rotation schedule (example for Tier 3 capability, monthly drills):**
- Month 1: Scenario A (Inventory Reorder Runaway)
- Month 2: Scenario B (Pricing Margin Collapse)
- Month 3: Scenario D (Workflow Bypass)
- Month 4: Scenario E (Cross-Domain Cascade)
- Month 5: Custom scenario (based on recent production anomalies)
- Month 6: Scenario C (Payroll forbidden autonomy test)

**Rationale:** Different scenarios test different detection mechanisms and response pathways.

---

### 10.3 Drill Governance Council

**Role:** Oversee drill program, review drill outcomes, approve corrective actions, recommend tier adjustments

**Members:**
- CTO (Chair)
- COO
- Chief Risk Officer
- Head of Enterprise Resilience
- Domain Owners (VP Operations, VP Sales, VP Finance)

**Meeting cadence:** Monthly

**Agenda:**
- Review last 30 days' drills (outcomes, pass/fail, lessons learned)
- Approve tier graduations/downgrades based on drill results
- Review drill calendar (upcoming drills)
- Discuss governance improvements

---

### 10.4 Board Reporting

**Quarterly board report must include:**
- Number of drills conducted (by tier, by domain)
- Pass/fail rate
- Real incidents (if any) and comparison to drill scenarios
- Tier changes (graduations and downgrades)
- Overall autonomy confidence score trend

**Format:** 1-page executive summary (per Phase 3.2 Section 9)

---

## BOARD & AUDIT READINESS

### 11.1 Purpose

Ensure drill program can answer **board-level questions** without panic or uncertainty.

### 11.2 Key Questions Drills Must Answer

**Question 1: "What went wrong?"**
- Answer from Artifact 4 (Root Cause Analysis)

**Question 2: "How fast did we stop it?"**
- Answer from Artifact 2 (Incident Timeline) — detection to kill-switch time

**Question 3: "Who decided?"**
- Answer from Artifact 3 (Kill-Switch Execution Record) — authorized by [Name, Role]

**Question 4: "What prevented real damage?"**
- Answer from Artifact 4 (Root Cause Analysis) — guardrails, detection mechanisms, kill-switch

**Question 5: "What changed after?"**
- Answer from Artifact 5 (Corrective Action Plan) — actions implemented

**Question 6: "Are we safer now than before?"**
- Answer from Artifact 6 (Lessons Learned) + drill trend data (pass/fail rate improving?)

---

### 11.3 Audit Committee Review

**Frequency:** Quarterly

**Materials provided:**
- Drill summary (number conducted, pass/fail rate)
- Lessons learned synthesis (top 3 insights)
- Tier changes (which capabilities graduated/downgraded)
- Real incidents comparison (if any real incidents occurred, how did they compare to drills?)

**Audit Committee questions:**
- "Are we conducting enough drills?" (frequency vs autonomy maturity)
- "Are drills realistic?" (do they simulate actual business risks?)
- "Are corrective actions implemented?" (or just documented and ignored?)
- "Is kill-switch reliable?" (has it ever failed?)

**Owner:** CTO presents, Incident Commander supports

---

## INTEGRATION WITH GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

### 12.1 Relationship to Phase 3.0 (Autonomous Operations Governance)

Phase 3.0 defines **where autonomy is allowed and under what conditions**.

Phase 3.3 validates that **governance controls actually work when autonomy fails**.

**Integration points:**
- Phase 3.0 defines autonomy tiers → Phase 3.3 validates tier-appropriate drills
- Phase 3.0 defines guardrails → Phase 3.3 tests guardrail effectiveness
- Phase 3.0 defines accountability → Phase 3.3 validates accountability in practice

---

### 12.2 Relationship to Phase 3.1 (Autonomy Risk Assessment Matrix)

Phase 3.1 defines **risk levels for each capability** (🟢🟡🟠🔴).

Phase 3.3 validates that **high-risk capabilities have robust detection and containment**.

**Integration points:**
- 🔴 High-risk capabilities → Monthly drills mandatory
- 🟡 Moderate-risk capabilities → Quarterly drills mandatory
- 🟢 Low-risk capabilities → Annual drills sufficient

---

### 12.3 Relationship to Phase 3.2 (Autonomy Control Dashboard)

Phase 3.2 provides **executive visibility into autonomy health**.

Phase 3.3 validates that **dashboard alerts work under incident conditions**.

**Integration points:**
- Phase 3.2 Dashboard generates alerts → Phase 3.3 drills validate alert accuracy and timeliness
- Phase 3.2 provides kill-switch UI → Phase 3.3 drills validate kill-switch execution
- Phase 3.2 Decision Log → Phase 3.3 drill actions logged

---

### 12.4 Relationship to Phase 1.3 (Audit, Compliance & Traceability)

Phase 1.3 defines **audit requirements for all business actions**.

Phase 3.3 validates that **audit trails survive incident conditions**.

**Integration points:**
- Phase 1.3 requires immutable logs → Phase 3.3 drills validate logs not corrupted during kill-switch
- Phase 1.3 defines retention requirements → Phase 3.3 drill artifacts follow same retention (7 years)

---

## ENFORCEMENT & ACCOUNTABILITY

### 13.1 Drill Participation is Mandatory

**No drills = No autonomy graduation.**

If domain refuses to participate in drills:
1. Capability remains at current tier (no graduation to Tier 3+)
2. If already at Tier 3+, downgrade to Tier 2 after 60 days non-compliance
3. If still non-compliant, downgrade to Tier 1 or suspend autonomy

**Exception process:** Domain Owner can request exemption from CTO + COO, but must provide written justification and alternative validation method.

---

### 13.2 Drill Failures Trigger Consequences

**First failure:**
- Root cause investigation required
- Corrective action plan required
- Re-drill within 30 days

**Second consecutive failure:**
- Autonomy downgrade (Tier 3 → Tier 2 or Tier 2 → Tier 1)
- Executive review (CTO + COO + Domain Owner)
- External consultant considered (if internal capability insufficient)

**Third consecutive failure:**
- Autonomy suspended indefinitely
- CEO briefing required
- Consider whether organization ready for autonomous operations

---

### 13.3 Ownership & Accountability

**Drill Program Owner:** CTO

**Responsibilities:**
- Ensure drills conducted on schedule
- Review drill outcomes
- Approve tier changes based on drill results
- Report to Board quarterly

**SLA:**
- 100% of required drills conducted within 30 days of scheduled date
- 100% of drill artifacts completed within 7 days post-drill
- 100% of corrective actions tracked to completion

**If SLA missed:** CTO must brief CEO + Board Audit Committee on reason and recovery plan.

---

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### 14.1 Drill Evolution

**Drills are not static.** As business evolves, drills must evolve.

**Sources of improvement:**
- **Real incidents:** If real incident occurs, convert it to drill scenario
- **Near misses:** If guardrail prevents incident, test whether detection would work at scale
- **Business model changes:** New products, new channels, new domains → new scenarios
- **Technology changes:** New integrations, new autonomy capabilities → new failure modes

**Review cadence:** Drill scenarios reviewed quarterly by Drill Governance Council

---

### 14.2 Industry Benchmarking

**Compare drill program to industry peers:**
- Are we conducting more/fewer drills?
- Are our pass rates similar?
- Are our incident classes aligned?

**Sources:**
- Industry conferences (risk management, operational resilience)
- Peer company collaboration (anonymized drill data sharing)
- Consultant assessment (third-party governance review)

**Goal:** Not to copy others, but to learn from others' failures.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Autonomy without testing is faith. Faith is not governance.

This drill program exists to prove that **our control mechanisms work**. Not in theory, but in practice. Not when everything is fine, but when things go wrong.

The purpose of drills is not to celebrate autonomy. The purpose is to **validate that we can stop autonomy instantly, cleanly, and completely**.

Every drill is a reminder:
- **Detection works** (we see failures before they compound)
- **Kill-switch works** (we can stop autonomy in <60 seconds)
- **Humans remain in control** (autonomy is delegated execution, not delegated accountability)
- **Audit trails survive** (we can reconstruct what happened, even under stress)
- **Organizations learn** (we improve after every drill)

**Autonomy is allowed only because we can stop it without fear.**

When executives press the kill-switch, they are not admitting failure. They are demonstrating control.

Autonomy exists to reduce operational burden, not to erode operational discipline.

This drill program ensures that autonomy remains a **governed capability**, not an uncontrolled experiment.
