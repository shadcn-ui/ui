# PHASE 3.4: AUTONOMY TIER PROMOTION & DOWNGRADE POLICY

**Document Classification:** Internal Policy — Binding  
**Effective Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Authority:** CTO, COO, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Data Officer, Chair of Autonomy Review Board  
**Audience:** CEO, CTO, COO, CFO, Chief Risk Officer, Board Audit Committee  
**Related Policies:** Phase 3.0 Autonomous Operations, Phase 3.1 Autonomy Risk Assessment Matrix, Phase 3.2 Autonomy Control Dashboard, Phase 3.3 Incident Simulation & Kill-Switch Drill

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the **mandatory governance policy for autonomy tier changes**. It specifies when autonomous capabilities may be promoted to higher autonomy levels, when they must be downgraded, who has decision authority, what evidence is required, and what safeguards protect the business during transitions.

**This is a governance and risk policy.**  
**This is not an engineering implementation guide.**  
**This is not an aspiration.**  
**This is a binding contract between executives and the board.**

**Core Principle:**  
**Autonomy is a privilege earned through performance, not a right granted through features.**

**Tier Movement Rules:**
- **Promotion:** Gradual, evidence-based, reversible
- **Downgrade:** Immediate when risk emerges, no exceptions
- **Authority:** Clearly defined, no ambiguity
- **Evidence:** Objective metrics, not subjective opinions
- **Safeguards:** Mandatory pilot periods, rollback plans, enhanced monitoring

**Key Governance Commitments:**
1. **No capability graduates to Tier 3+ without passing incident drill** (Phase 3.3)
2. **No capability remains at Tier 3+ after second consecutive drill failure**
3. **No tier change without explicit executive authorization**
4. **No promotion during active incident investigation**
5. **No downgrade appeals delay execution** (downgrade first, appeal later)

---

## PURPOSE & PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1 Why This Policy Exists

Autonomous systems create operational leverage. They also create operational risk.

The question is not "Should we use autonomy?" The question is:

**"How do we expand autonomy when it works and contract it when it doesn't?"**

Without clear promotion and downgrade rules:
- Engineers will over-automate (feature enthusiasm)
- Executives will under-trust (risk aversion)
- Business will suffer (either from excessive manual work or excessive autonomy risk)

This policy exists to **balance expansion with discipline**.

---

### 1.2 Autonomy as Earned Privilege

**Autonomy is not a default state.**

Every capability starts at **Tier 0 (Manual)** or **Tier 1 (Recommendation Only)**.

To graduate to higher tiers, the capability must **prove itself**:
- Performance meets expectations
- Risk remains contained
- Humans trust the decisions
- Audit trails are complete
- Drills validate control mechanisms

**Promotion = System earned trust through results.**

**Downgrade = System lost trust through failure.**

---

### 1.3 Conservative Bias by Design

This policy is **intentionally conservative**.

**Default response to uncertainty:** Wait, do not promote.

**Default response to risk:** Downgrade, do not wait.

**Rationale:**
- **Premature promotion:** Risk of autonomy failure, financial loss, compliance violation
- **Premature downgrade:** Risk of manual workload increase, operational inefficiency

**Financial harm from autonomy failure > Operational inconvenience from manual process.**

Therefore: **When in doubt, stay at lower tier or downgrade.**

---

### 1.4 What This Policy Governs

**In Scope:**
- Promotion criteria (when can autonomy increase?)
- Downgrade triggers (when must autonomy decrease?)
- Decision authority (who decides?)
- Evidence requirements (what data is needed?)
- Safeguards (what protections are mandatory?)
- Timelines (how long does promotion take?)
- Appeals process (can downgrades be challenged?)

**Out of Scope:**
- Technical implementation (how to build autonomous logic)
- User interface design (how to display autonomy state)
- Algorithm selection (which ML models to use)
- Data engineering (how to prepare training data)

---

## AUTONOMY TIER FRAMEWORK (RECAP)

### 2.1 Tier Definitions

**Recap from Phase 3.0 and Phase 3.1:**

| Tier | Name | Autonomous Behavior | Human Involvement | Risk Level |
|------|------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Tier 0** | Manual | None — human executes | 100% manual | Lowest |
| **Tier 1** | Recommendation | System suggests, human decides | Human approves every action | Low |
| **Tier 2** | Auto-Action with Approval | System acts, human approves before commit | Human approves before commit | Moderate |
| **Tier 3** | Auto-Action within Guardrails | System acts autonomously within limits | Human oversight, periodic review | High |
| **Tier 4** | Self-Tuning | System adjusts own parameters | Human oversight, exception handling | Highest |

**Typical progression:** 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → (rarely) 4

**Not all capabilities reach Tier 4.** Most stable at Tier 2 or Tier 3.

---

### 2.2 Tier 0 → Tier 1: Manual to Recommendation

**What changes:**
- System begins providing recommendations
- Humans decide whether to follow

**Use case:**
- New capability, unproven
- High-variability domain
- Building trust before automation

**Example:** New discount recommendation engine suggests discounts, but sales team manually approves every discount.

---

### 2.3 Tier 1 → Tier 2: Recommendation to Auto-Action with Approval

**What changes:**
- System executes action automatically
- Human reviews and approves before final commit
- Approval can reject or modify

**Use case:**
- Recommendation accuracy proven
- Humans still want review control
- Moderate-risk actions

**Example:** System generates purchase order automatically, but procurement manager must approve before sending to supplier.

---

### 2.4 Tier 2 → Tier 3: Auto-Action with Approval to Auto-Action within Guardrails

**What changes:**
- System executes and commits without case-by-case human approval
- Humans define guardrails (thresholds, limits, rules)
- Humans review exceptions and periodic reports

**Use case:**
- High-volume, repetitive actions
- Proven accuracy and stability
- Low per-action risk

**Example:** System automatically reorders inventory for SKUs with proven demand patterns, within $5K-$50K range, without manager approval. Manager reviews weekly summary.

---

### 2.5 Tier 3 → Tier 4: Auto-Action to Self-Tuning

**What changes:**
- System adjusts own thresholds, parameters, or logic
- Humans define meta-rules (rules about how system adjusts rules)
- Humans audit adjustments post-facto

**Use case:**
- Highly mature capability
- Domain conditions change frequently
- Manual tuning creates bottleneck

**Example:** Inventory reorder system automatically adjusts safety stock thresholds based on demand volatility, within defined bounds. Humans review adjustment log monthly.

**WARNING:** Tier 4 is rare. Most capabilities never reach Tier 4. Tier 4 requires exceptional maturity, stability, and trust.

---

## PROMOTION FRAMEWORK (EARNING HIGHER AUTONOMY)

### 3.1 Promotion Philosophy

**Promotion is not automatic.**

Even if a capability performs well, promotion requires:
- Explicit request
- Evidence submission
- Executive review
- Pilot validation
- Final authorization

**No "auto-promotion."** No "we've been running this for 6 months so let's just flip it to Tier 3."

---

### 3.2 Promotion Eligibility Criteria

**To be ELIGIBLE for promotion consideration, capability must meet ALL baseline criteria:**

#### Criterion 1: Minimum Time at Current Tier

| Current Tier | Minimum Time Before Promotion Eligible |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Tier 0** | Not applicable (can request Tier 1 anytime) |
| **Tier 1** | 90 days minimum |
| **Tier 2** | 180 days minimum |
| **Tier 3** | 365 days minimum (before Tier 4 consideration) |

**Rationale:** Adequate time to observe seasonal variations, edge cases, and long-tail failures.

**Exception process:** CTO + COO can waive time requirement if capability demonstrates exceptional stability and passes all other criteria. Exception requires written justification.

---

#### Criterion 2: No Active Incidents

**Capability must have ZERO active incidents:**
- No unresolved CLASS 1-4 incidents
- No ongoing investigation
- No pending corrective actions

**If incident in last 30 days:** Promotion ineligible until incident fully resolved and 30-day clean period observed.

---

#### Criterion 3: Performance Meets Thresholds

**Minimum performance thresholds (trailing 90 days):**

| Metric | Tier 1→2 | Tier 2→3 | Tier 3→4 |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | 90% | 95% | 98% |
| **Override Rate** | <15% | <5% | <2% |
| **Incident Count** | 0 CLASS 3-4 | 0 CLASS 2-4 | 0 CLASS 1-4 |
| **Confidence Score** | 70+ | 80+ | 90+ |
| **Drift Indicator** | Stable or Improving | Stable | Stable |

**Note:** These are MINIMUM thresholds. Meeting thresholds does not guarantee promotion; failing thresholds guarantees ineligibility.

---

#### Criterion 4: Drill Validation (Tier 2→3 and above)

**For promotion to Tier 3+, capability must pass incident drill (Phase 3.3):**
- Drill conducted within 90 days of promotion request
- Drill result: PASS
- Kill-switch validated (<60 second response)
- Audit trail complete

**No drill pass = No Tier 3+ promotion.** Non-negotiable.

---

#### Criterion 5: Risk Classification Approval

**Capability risk level (from Phase 3.1) must permit desired tier:**

| Risk Level | Maximum Permitted Tier |
|------------|------------------------|
| **🟢 Low Risk** | Tier 4 (if justified) |
| **🟡 Moderate Risk** | Tier 3 |
| **🟠 High Risk** | Tier 2 |
| **🔴 Critical Risk** | Tier 1 (Tier 0 preferred) |

**Example:** A capability classified as 🟠 High Risk cannot be promoted to Tier 3, regardless of performance.

**Exception:** Risk classification can be challenged and reassessed through Risk Review Board (see Section 3.7), but promotion cannot proceed until risk reclassification approved.

---

### 3.3 Promotion Request Process

**Promotion is initiated by Domain Owner, not by engineering team.**

#### Step 1: Domain Owner Submits Promotion Request

**Required documentation:**

**A. Promotion Request Form**
- Capability name
- Current tier
- Requested tier
- Business justification (why is promotion necessary?)
- Risk assessment (what could go wrong?)

**B. Performance Evidence Package**
- 90-day performance metrics (accuracy, override rate, confidence score)
- Drill results (if promoting to Tier 3+)
- Incident history (demonstrate zero active incidents)
- User feedback (operational teams' trust level)

**C. Safeguard Plan**
- Pilot plan (gradual rollout strategy)
- Rollback plan (how to revert if promotion fails)
- Enhanced monitoring plan (what additional monitoring during pilot)
- Downgrade triggers (what thresholds trigger automatic downgrade)

**Submission to:** Autonomy Review Board

---

#### Step 2: Autonomy Review Board Evaluation

**Board composition:**
- CTO (Chair)
- COO
- Chief Risk Officer
- Chief Data Officer
- Domain Owner (presenting)
- Finance Guardian (if financial risk involved)

**Evaluation criteria:**
1. **Eligibility check:** Does capability meet all baseline criteria (Section 3.2)?
2. **Evidence review:** Is performance data credible and sufficient?
3. **Risk assessment:** Is risk classification accurate? Are safeguards adequate?
4. **Business need:** Is promotion justified or is current tier sufficient?
5. **Organizational readiness:** Is team prepared to handle higher autonomy?

**Board decision options:**
- **Approve:** Proceed to pilot phase
- **Approve with Conditions:** Proceed to pilot with additional safeguards
- **Defer:** Request additional evidence or time at current tier
- **Reject:** Promotion not justified or risk too high

**Timeline:** Board reviews promotion requests monthly. Submission deadline: 15th of month for review in following month.

---

#### Step 3: Pilot Phase (Mandatory for Tier 2→3+ Promotions)

**Pilot = Limited-scope deployment at higher tier before full rollout.**

**Pilot parameters:**

| Current Tier | Pilot Scope | Pilot Duration |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1→2** | 10-20% of actions | 30 days |
| **Tier 2→3** | 10-20% of actions | 60 days |
| **Tier 3→4** | 5-10% of actions | 90 days |

**Pilot monitoring:**
- Daily confidence score review (Phase 3.2 Dashboard)
- Weekly performance report to Domain Owner
- Immediate alert if any pilot-related incident occurs

**Pilot success criteria:**
- Performance thresholds maintained throughout pilot
- Zero incidents during pilot
- Override rate at or below target
- Domain Owner confirms operational readiness

**Pilot failure criteria (automatic downgrade back to prior tier):**
- Any CLASS 2+ incident
- Performance below threshold for 7+ consecutive days
- Override rate exceeds target by 5+ percentage points
- Domain Owner requests early termination

---

#### Step 4: Full Promotion Authorization

**After successful pilot:**

**Authorization required:**

| Promotion | Authorization Required |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Tier 0→1** | Domain Owner |
| **Tier 1→2** | Domain Owner + CTO or COO |
| **Tier 2→3** | CTO + COO + Chief Risk Officer |
| **Tier 3→4** | CEO + CTO + COO + CFO (all four) |

**Authorization documentation:**
- Signed promotion authorization memo
- Pilot results summary
- Confirmation that all safeguards remain in place
- Post-promotion monitoring plan (90-180 days enhanced monitoring)

**Logged in:** Phase 3.2 Decision Log, Phase 1.3 Audit Log

---

### 3.4 Post-Promotion Monitoring (Enhanced Period)

**After full promotion, capability enters enhanced monitoring period:**

**Duration:**
- Tier 1→2: 90 days
- Tier 2→3: 180 days
- Tier 3→4: 365 days

**Enhanced monitoring includes:**
- Weekly performance review (instead of monthly)
- Weekly override analysis
- Monthly executive review (Domain Owner + CTO)
- Immediate incident response (no tolerance for degradation)

**Exit criteria (return to normal monitoring):**
- Enhanced period complete
- Zero incidents during period
- Performance stable or improving
- Domain Owner confirms confidence

**If incident during enhanced period:**
- Immediate downgrade to prior tier
- Root cause investigation
- Re-promotion requires full process (no shortcuts)

---

### 3.5 Promotion Rejection & Resubmission

**If Autonomy Review Board rejects promotion:**

**Domain Owner receives:**
- Written rejection rationale (what criteria were not met?)
- Specific improvement recommendations
- Estimated timeline for resubmission eligibility

**Resubmission rules:**
- Minimum 90 days before resubmission (unless Board specifies shorter period)
- Must address all rejection reasons
- Must provide new evidence (not same evidence repackaged)

**No appeals of promotion rejection.** Board decision is final. Rejected capabilities remain at current tier.

---

### 3.6 Promotion Acceleration (Exception Process)

**In rare cases, business urgency may justify accelerated promotion.**

**Allowed circumstances:**
- Critical business need (e.g., competitive threat, regulatory deadline)
- Capability demonstrates exceptional stability (e.g., 99%+ accuracy, zero incidents)
- Operational bottleneck creating significant business harm

**Acceleration does NOT waive:**
- Drill requirement (still mandatory for Tier 3+)
- Evidence requirements (still need performance data)
- Authorization requirements (still need executive approval)

**Acceleration CAN reduce:**
- Minimum time at current tier (e.g., 90 days → 60 days for Tier 1→2)
- Pilot duration (e.g., 60 days → 30 days for Tier 2→3)

**Acceleration authorization:**
- CEO + CTO + COO (all three must approve)
- Written justification required (business case + risk acceptance statement)
- Enhanced monitoring automatically applied (weekly executive review)

**Risk:** Accelerated promotions carry higher failure risk. If failure occurs, Domain Owner and approving executives accountable.

---

### 3.7 Risk Reclassification Process

**If capability's risk level (Phase 3.1) is blocking desired promotion:**

**Domain Owner can request risk reclassification:**

**Example:** Capability classified as 🟠 High Risk (max Tier 2), but Domain Owner believes it should be 🟡 Moderate Risk (max Tier 3).

**Risk reclassification request must include:**
- Why current risk classification is inaccurate
- What has changed to reduce risk (e.g., new guardrails, better data quality)
- Evidence that risk dimensions (Financial, Cascade, Compliance, Reversibility) are lower than originally assessed

**Review authority:** Chief Risk Officer + Autonomy Review Board

**Timeline:** Reviewed quarterly (not monthly)

**Outcome:**
- **Approved:** Risk level adjusted in Phase 3.1 Risk Matrix, promotion can proceed
- **Rejected:** Risk level remains, promotion blocked

**Note:** Risk reclassification is rare and difficult. Default assumption: Original risk classification was correct.

---

## DOWNGRADE FRAMEWORK (REDUCING OR REMOVING AUTONOMY)

### 4.1 Downgrade Philosophy

**Downgrade is not failure. Downgrade is risk management.**

**When autonomy loses trust, downgrade is the correct response.**

**Key principles:**
1. **Downgrade immediately, investigate later** — Do not wait for perfect information
2. **Downgrade first, appeal later** — Risk reduction takes priority over operational convenience
3. **Downgrade is temporary** — Capability can be re-promoted after remediation

**No stigma attached to downgrade.** Downgrade demonstrates governance is working.

---

### 4.2 Downgrade Triggers (Automatic)

**Certain conditions trigger AUTOMATIC downgrade. No executive discretion.**

#### Trigger 1: Incident Severity

| Incident Class | Automatic Downgrade |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **CLASS 1** (Local Misfire) | Tier 3-4 → Tier 2 (optional; Domain Owner decides) |
| **CLASS 2** (Domain Drift) | Tier 3-4 → Tier 2 (mandatory) |
| **CLASS 3** (Cross-Domain Cascade) | All tiers → Tier 1 or Tier 0 (mandatory) |
| **CLASS 4** (Systemic Failure) | All tiers → Tier 0 (mandatory, full suspension) |

**Execution timeline:** Within 24 hours of incident classification

---

#### Trigger 2: Drill Failure

| Drill Outcome | Automatic Downgrade |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **First drill failure** | No automatic downgrade (re-drill required) |
| **Second consecutive drill failure** | Tier 3-4 → Tier 2 (mandatory) |
| **Third consecutive drill failure** | All tiers → Tier 0 (mandatory, indefinite suspension) |

**Execution timeline:** Within 7 days of drill failure determination

---

#### Trigger 3: Confidence Score Erosion

| Confidence Score | Automatic Downgrade |
|------------------|---------------------|
| **Score <70** | Tier 3-4 → Tier 2 (within 7 days) |
| **Score <60** | Tier 2-4 → Tier 1 (within 48 hours) |
| **Score <50** | All tiers → Tier 0 (within 24 hours) |

**Note:** Confidence score from Phase 3.2 Dashboard (composite metric: accuracy, override rate, business impact, time since incident)

---

#### Trigger 4: Override Rate Spike

| Override Rate (7-day avg) | Automatic Downgrade |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **>10%** (Tier 3-4) | Tier 3-4 → Tier 2 (within 7 days) |
| **>20%** (any tier) | All tiers → Tier 1 (within 48 hours) |
| **>30%** (any tier) | All tiers → Tier 0 (within 24 hours) |

**Rationale:** High override rate = humans do not trust autonomy = autonomy not ready for higher tier

---

#### Trigger 5: Drift Indicator (Instability)

| Drift State | Automatic Downgrade |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Drifting** (5-10% degradation) | Tier 3-4 → Tier 2 (within 14 days if not corrected) |
| **Unstable** (>10% degradation) | Tier 3-4 → Tier 2 (within 7 days) |
| **Unstable + Confidence <70** | All tiers → Tier 1 (within 48 hours) |

---

### 4.3 Downgrade Triggers (Discretionary)

**Executives MAY trigger downgrade even if automatic triggers not met:**

#### Discretionary Trigger 1: Loss of Trust

**Domain Owner, CTO, COO, or Chief Risk Officer can request downgrade if:**
- Operational teams losing confidence in capability
- Pattern of near-misses (guardrails catching errors frequently)
- Business context changes making autonomy riskier

**Process:**
- Submit downgrade request to Autonomy Review Board
- Board evaluates within 7 days
- If approved, downgrade within 48 hours

---

#### Discretionary Trigger 2: Regulatory or Compliance Concern

**Chief Risk Officer or Legal can request immediate downgrade if:**
- New regulation affects capability
- Audit finding requires enhanced controls
- Compliance risk emerges

**Process:**
- Chief Risk Officer declares compliance concern
- CTO notified immediately
- Downgrade within 24 hours (no Board approval required for compliance-driven downgrade)

---

#### Discretionary Trigger 3: Business Model Change

**If business model or domain conditions change significantly:**
- New product line with different risk profile
- Market conditions create higher variability
- Integration with external system increases complexity

**Process:**
- Domain Owner requests downgrade or enhanced monitoring
- CTO + COO approve
- Downgrade within 7 days

---

### 4.4 Downgrade Execution Process

**Downgrade follows same mechanism as kill-switch (Phase 3.3):**

#### Step 1: Downgrade Decision

**Who decides:**
- **Automatic triggers:** System detects, alerts executive, executive confirms within 24 hours
- **Discretionary triggers:** Requesting executive + CTO approval

**Documentation required:**
- Downgrade trigger (what caused downgrade?)
- Current tier → Target tier
- Expected operational impact (what manual work will be required?)
- Timeline for root cause investigation and re-promotion consideration

---

#### Step 2: Downgrade Notification

**Notify:**
- Domain Owner (immediate)
- Operational teams (within 2 hours)
- CEO, CFO (within 24 hours for Tier 3-4 downgrades)
- Board Audit Committee (within 7 days for CLASS 3-4 incident-driven downgrades)

**Notification content:**
- What was downgraded (capability + domain)
- Why (trigger reason)
- What changes operationally (manual approval now required)
- Expected duration (when will re-promotion be considered?)

---

#### Step 3: System Downgrade Execution

**Technical execution (same as Phase 3.3 kill-switch):**
- Capability tier adjusted in system configuration
- Pending autonomous actions moved to manual approval queue
- Safe mode activated (if downgrading to Tier 0)
- Enhanced logging enabled

**Timeline:** <60 seconds from executive confirmation to full downgrade

---

#### Step 4: Post-Downgrade Monitoring

**After downgrade:**
- Root cause investigation (within 7 days)
- Corrective action plan (within 14 days)
- Weekly status updates to CTO + COO
- Re-promotion consideration after corrective actions validated

---

### 4.5 Emergency Downgrade (Immediate Suspension)

**For CLASS 4 incidents or systemic trust breach:**

**Emergency downgrade = Immediate Tier 0 (full suspension) without waiting for Board review.**

**Authorization:**
- CEO, CTO, COO, CFO (any one can trigger)
- Chief Risk Officer (for compliance emergencies)

**Execution:** <60 seconds

**Post-emergency actions:**
- CEO briefing within 2 hours
- Board Audit Committee notification within 24 hours
- War room convened (all executives)
- Public communication considered (if customer-facing impact)

---

### 4.6 Downgrade Appeals Process

**Domain Owners can appeal discretionary downgrades (not automatic downgrades).**

**Appeal grounds:**
- Downgrade trigger was inaccurate (e.g., data measurement error)
- Downgrade is disproportionate to risk (e.g., minor issue triggering major downgrade)
- Business harm from downgrade exceeds risk from maintaining tier

**Appeal process:**
1. Domain Owner submits appeal to Autonomy Review Board (within 7 days of downgrade)
2. Board reviews appeal within 14 days
3. Board decision options:
   - **Uphold downgrade:** Capability remains at lower tier
   - **Reverse downgrade:** Capability restored to prior tier
   - **Modify downgrade:** Capability moved to intermediate tier (e.g., downgraded to Tier 1 instead of Tier 0)

**CRITICAL RULE: Downgrade remains in effect during appeal.** Appeal does not delay downgrade execution.

**Automatic downgrades are NOT appealable.** If automatic trigger met, downgrade is non-negotiable. Domain Owner can work toward re-promotion after remediation.

---

## DECISION AUTHORITY MATRIX

### 5.1 Purpose

**Eliminate ambiguity about who decides what.**

---

### 5.2 Promotion Authority

| Decision | Authority Required | Appeal Rights |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Tier 0→1 Promotion** | Domain Owner | None (Domain Owner decision final) |
| **Tier 1→2 Promotion** | Domain Owner + (CTO or COO) | CTO/COO can overrule Domain Owner |
| **Tier 2→3 Promotion** | CTO + COO + Chief Risk Officer (all three) | None (consensus required) |
| **Tier 3→4 Promotion** | CEO + CTO + COO + CFO (all four) | None (consensus required) |
| **Promotion Acceleration** | CEO + CTO + COO (all three) | None |
| **Risk Reclassification** | Chief Risk Officer + Autonomy Review Board | None |

---

### 5.3 Downgrade Authority

| Decision | Authority Required | Appeal Rights |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Automatic Downgrade (Tier 3-4→2)** | System alert + Executive confirmation | None (automatic trigger) |
| **Automatic Downgrade (→Tier 1 or 0)** | System alert + Executive confirmation | None (automatic trigger) |
| **Discretionary Downgrade** | CTO + COO | Domain Owner can appeal to Autonomy Review Board |
| **Compliance-Driven Downgrade** | Chief Risk Officer (unilateral) | None (compliance takes priority) |
| **Emergency Downgrade (CLASS 4)** | CEO, CTO, COO, or CFO (any one) | None (emergency action) |

---

### 5.4 Autonomy Review Board Composition & Authority

**Purpose:** Governing body for autonomy tier decisions

**Members:**
- CTO (Chair)
- COO (Vice Chair)

- Approve exceptions and accelerations (with CEO concurrence for accelerations)

**Meeting cadence:** Monthly (3rd Thursday of each month)

**Quorum:** 5 of 7 members (must include CTO or COO)

**Decision method:** Majority vote (4 of 7); CTO breaks ties

---

## EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

### 6.1 Purpose

**Tier changes must be evidence-based, not opinion-based.**

---

### 6.2 Performance Evidence (Quantitative)

**Required for all promotion requests:**

**A. Accuracy Metrics (90-day trailing)**
- Autonomous action accuracy rate (% of actions matching expected outcome)
- Comparison to human baseline (if available)
- Trend direction (improving, stable, degrading)

**B. Override Metrics (90-day trailing)**
- Override frequency (% of autonomous actions overridden by humans)
- Override reason distribution (incorrect recommendation, timing issue, context miss, policy violation)
- Override trend (increasing = trust eroding)

**C. Incident History (90-day trailing)**
- Incident count by class (CLASS 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Incident root causes
- Time since last incident

**D. Confidence Score (Phase 3.2 Dashboard)**
- Current score (0-100)
- 90-day trend
- Component breakdown (accuracy, override rate, business impact, time since incident)

**E. Drift Indicator (Phase 3.2 Dashboard)**
- Current state (stable, drifting, unstable)
- Drift velocity (improving, stable, degrading)

---

### 6.3 Operational Evidence (Qualitative)

**Required for Tier 2→3+ promotions:**

**A. User Trust Survey**
- Operational team survey: "Do you trust this capability's autonomous decisions?" (5-point scale)
- Minimum average score: 4.0/5.0 for Tier 3 promotion
- Sample size: All users who interact with capability (minimum 5 users)

**B. Domain Owner Confidence Statement**
- Written statement: "I am confident this capability is ready for [Target Tier] autonomy."
- Justification: Why is Domain Owner confident?
- Risk acknowledgment: What could go wrong, and how will we detect/respond?

**C. Operational Impact Assessment**
- How will higher autonomy change operational workload? (quantify hours saved)
- What manual fallback capacity exists if downgrade required? (can team absorb manual work?)
- What training is required for operational team? (do they understand new tier behavior?)

---

### 6.4 Drill Evidence (Mandatory for Tier 3+)

**Required for Tier 2→3+ promotions:**

**A. Drill Execution Record (Phase 3.3)**
- Drill date and scenario
- Drill outcome (PASS/FAIL)
- Detection time (incident detected within threshold?)
- Kill-switch execution time (<60 seconds?)
- Data integrity check (no corruption?)
- Audit trail completeness

**B. Drill Lessons Learned**
- What went well during drill?
- What went poorly?
- What improvements implemented post-drill?

**No drill pass = No Tier 3+ promotion.** Non-negotiable.

---

### 6.5 Risk Evidence (Mandatory for All Promotions)

**Required for all promotion requests:**

**A. Phase 3.1 Risk Classification**
- Current risk level (🟢🟡🟠🔴)
- Risk dimensions: Financial, Cascade, Compliance, Reversibility
- Maximum permitted tier based on risk level

**B. Safeguard Validation**
- What guardrails exist? (thresholds, limits, approval chains)
- Have guardrails been tested? (drill results)
- What happens if guardrails fail? (rollback plan)

**C. Compliance Check**
- Is capability on Phase 3.1 Forbidden Autonomy List? (if yes, promotion blocked)
- Does capability affect compliance-sensitive processes? (if yes, enhanced scrutiny)
- Have external auditors reviewed capability? (for financial/compliance capabilities)

---

### 6.6 Evidence Validation

**All evidence must be:**
- **Credible:** Data from production systems (Phase 1.3 Audit Logs, Phase 3.2 Dashboard)
- **Recent:** Trailing 90 days (not older data)
- **Complete:** No missing metrics or "data not available" gaps
- **Verifiable:** Can be audited or reproduced

**Evidence manipulation = immediate promotion rejection + potential capability suspension.**

---

## SAFEGUARDS (MANDATORY PROTECTIONS)

### 7.1 Purpose

**Safeguards reduce risk during tier changes.**

---

### 7.2 Promotion Safeguards

#### Safeguard 1: Gradual Rollout (Pilot Phase)

**Mandatory for Tier 2→3+ promotions:**
- Start with 10-20% of actions at higher tier
- Monitor for 30-90 days
- Expand to 100% only after pilot success

**Rollback trigger:** Any incident during pilot → immediate return to prior tier

---

#### Safeguard 2: Enhanced Monitoring Period

**Mandatory for all promotions:**
- 90-180 day enhanced monitoring after full promotion
- Weekly performance reviews (instead of monthly)
- Immediate executive notification of any anomaly

**Exit criteria:** Clean performance for full monitoring period

---

#### Safeguard 3: Rollback Plan

**Mandatory for all promotions:**
- Pre-defined rollback procedure (how to downgrade quickly)
- Manual fallback capacity (can operational team handle manual workload?)
- Communication plan (how to notify users of rollback)

**Rollback plan approved by:** Domain Owner + CTO before promotion proceeds

---

#### Safeguard 4: Enhanced Audit Logging

**Mandatory for Tier 3+ autonomy:**
- Every autonomous action logged (Phase 1.3 Audit Log)
- Additional context captured (input data, decision logic, confidence level)
- Logs retained for 7 years (compliance requirement)

---

### 7.3 Downgrade Safeguards

#### Safeguard 1: Operational Continuity

**Before downgrade execution:**
- Validate manual fallback procedures exist and are documented
- Confirm operational team has capacity to absorb manual workload
- Provide user training (if needed) on manual process

---

#### Safeguard 2: Data Integrity Preservation

**During downgrade execution:**
- No partial writes or orphaned transactions
- In-flight actions complete or rollback cleanly
- Pending actions moved to manual approval queue (not lost)

---

#### Safeguard 3: Communication Transparency

**After downgrade execution:**
- Notify operational teams immediately (what changed, what to do now)
- Notify executives within 24 hours (what was downgraded, why)
- Notify Board (if CLASS 3-4 incident triggered downgrade)

---

### 7.4 Cross-Tier Safeguards

#### Safeguard 1: Forbidden Autonomy (Phase 3.1)

**Certain capabilities are NEVER promoted beyond Tier 1:**
- Payroll calculation
- Tax computation
- Journal entry creation
- Regulatory filing
- Contract signature
- Employee termination

**No exceptions.** Even perfect performance does not override forbidden status.

---

#### Safeguard 2: Maximum Tier Based on Risk

**Risk level limits maximum tier (per Section 3.2.5):**
- 🔴 Critical Risk → Max Tier 1
- 🟠 High Risk → Max Tier 2
- 🟡 Moderate Risk → Max Tier 3
- 🟢 Low Risk → Max Tier 4 (if justified)

---

#### Safeguard 3: Concurrent Autonomy Limits

**Prevent over-automation:**
- No more than 50% of domain capabilities at Tier 3+ simultaneously
- If >50% at Tier 3+, new promotions blocked until others downgraded or demonstrated stable

**Rationale:** Excessive autonomy concentration creates systemic risk (too many autonomous actions, insufficient human oversight capacity)

---

## TIMELINES & CADENCE

### 8.1 Promotion Timelines

| Promotion Path | Minimum Time at Current Tier | Pilot Duration | Enhanced Monitoring | Total Timeline |
|----------------|------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Tier 0→1** | None | Not required | 90 days | 90 days |
| **Tier 1→2** | 90 days | 30 days | 90 days | 210 days |
| **Tier 2→3** | 180 days | 60 days | 180 days | 420 days |
| **Tier 3→4** | 365 days | 90 days | 365 days | 820 days |

**Interpretation:** Reaching Tier 3 from Tier 0 = minimum 630 days (21 months). Reaching Tier 4 from Tier 0 = minimum 1,450 days (48 months / 4 years).

**Rationale:** Autonomy maturity requires time to observe edge cases, seasonal variations, and long-tail risks.

---

### 8.2 Downgrade Timelines

| Downgrade Trigger | Execution Timeline |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **CLASS 1 Incident** | Within 7 days (optional) |
| **CLASS 2 Incident** | Within 24 hours |
| **CLASS 3 Incident** | Within 4 hours |
| **CLASS 4 Incident** | <60 seconds (emergency) |
| **Confidence <70** | Within 7 days |
| **Confidence <60** | Within 48 hours |
| **Confidence <50** | Within 24 hours |
| **Override >10%** | Within 7 days |
| **Override >20%** | Within 48 hours |
| **Compliance concern** | Within 24 hours |

**Rule:** Downgrades execute faster than promotions. Risk reduction is urgent; expansion can wait.

---

### 8.3 Review Cadence

**Autonomy Review Board meetings:** Monthly

**Promotion request review:** Monthly (submitted by 15th, reviewed in following month)

**Drill program review:** Monthly (drill outcomes from prior 30 days)

**Risk reclassification review:** Quarterly

**Board reporting:** Quarterly (autonomy posture summary per Phase 3.2 Section 9)

---

## ACCOUNTABILITY & ENFORCEMENT

### 9.1 Domain Owner Accountability

**Domain Owners are accountable for:**
- Performance of autonomous capabilities in their domain
- Timeliness and accuracy of promotion requests
- Operational readiness for tier changes
- Post-promotion monitoring and incident response

**If Domain Owner neglects responsibilities:**
- Promotion requests rejected until accountability demonstrated
- CTO can appoint interim Domain Owner
- Persistent negligence → autonomy suspended in domain

---

### 9.2 Executive Accountability

**CTO, COO, Chief Risk Officer are accountable for:**
- Oversight of promotion/downgrade governance
- Timely review of promotion requests
- Enforcement of automatic downgrade triggers
- Board reporting accuracy

**If executives fail to enforce policy:**
- CEO intervention required
- Board Audit Committee escalation
- External audit or governance consultant engaged

---

### 9.3 Board Oversight

**Board Audit Committee reviews:**
- Quarterly autonomy posture reports (Phase 3.2 Section 9)
- Annual policy compliance assessment
- Tier change trends (are we expanding or contracting autonomy? Why?)
- Incident history (frequency, severity, response effectiveness)

**Board can:**
- Request policy revisions
- Mandate external audit
- Suspend autonomy in any domain
- Replace CTO/COO if governance failure systemic

---

### 9.4 Policy Compliance Audit

**Annual audit (conducted by Internal Audit + Chief Risk Officer):**

**Audit questions:**
1. Were all promotions properly authorized? (check decision log against authority matrix)
2. Were all automatic downgrades executed within timeline? (check incident response times)
3. Were all drills conducted on schedule? (check drill calendar vs actual execution)
4. Were all promotion requests supported by adequate evidence? (sample 10 promotions, validate evidence)
5. Were all forbidden capabilities maintained at Tier 0-1? (verify no violations)

**Audit findings:**
- **Clean audit:** No policy violations, governance working as designed
- **Minor findings:** 1-2 procedural issues, corrective action required
- **Major findings:** Systemic non-compliance, executive accountability discussion, potential external review

---

## INTEGRATION WITH GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

### 10.1 Relationship to Phase 3.1 (Risk Assessment Matrix)

Phase 3.1 defines **risk levels and maximum permitted tiers**.

Phase 3.4 enforces **promotion limits based on risk classification**.

**Integration:** Promotion requests automatically check Phase 3.1 risk level. If requested tier exceeds permitted tier, promotion blocked.

---

### 10.2 Relationship to Phase 3.2 (Control Dashboard)

Phase 3.2 provides **real-time visibility into autonomy health**.

Phase 3.4 uses **dashboard metrics as automatic downgrade triggers**.

**Integration:** Dashboard monitors confidence score, override rate, drift indicator. When thresholds crossed, dashboard generates downgrade alert routed to CTO.

---

### 10.3 Relationship to Phase 3.3 (Incident Drills)

Phase 3.3 defines **mandatory incident simulation program**.

Phase 3.4 requires **drill pass for Tier 3+ promotion**.

**Integration:** Promotion requests for Tier 3+ require drill evidence. Autonomy Review Board validates drill results before approving promotion.

---

### 10.4 Relationship to Phase 1.3 (Audit & Traceability)

Phase 1.3 requires **immutable audit logs for all business actions**.

Phase 3.4 requires **decision logging for all tier changes**.

**Integration:** Every promotion and downgrade logged in Phase 1.3 Audit Log + Phase 3.2 Decision Log. Board can audit tier change history.

---

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### 11.1 Policy Review Cadence

**This policy is reviewed:**
- **Annually:** By CTO + COO + Chief Risk Officer (full policy review)
- **Quarterly:** By Autonomy Review Board (operational effectiveness review)
- **On-demand:** After any CLASS 4 incident (policy failure analysis)

**Review questions:**
- Are promotion criteria too strict or too lenient?
- Are automatic downgrade triggers appropriate?
- Are timelines realistic?
- Is decision authority matrix clear and effective?

---

### 11.2 Learning from Tier Changes

**After every tier change (up or down):**
- **3-month retrospective:** Did tier change achieve intended outcome?
- **Lessons learned:** What surprised us? What would we do differently?
- **Policy refinement:** Should criteria or process change?

**Goal:** Continuously improve promotion/downgrade governance based on empirical results.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Autonomy is not a feature to deploy. Autonomy is a privilege to earn.

This policy exists to ensure that **expansion of autonomy is disciplined, evidence-based, and reversible**.

**Promotion is gradual.** We do not jump from manual to fully autonomous overnight. We prove capability at each tier before advancing.

**Downgrade is immediate.** We do not wait for perfect information when risk emerges. We reduce autonomy first, investigate later.

**Authority is clear.** We do not debate who decides. This policy defines explicit decision authority for every tier change.

**Evidence is objective.** We do not promote based on enthusiasm or downgrade based on fear. We use quantitative metrics and operational evidence.

**Safeguards are mandatory.** We do not promote without rollback plans. We do not downgrade without preserving data integrity.

The goal is **not to maximize autonomy**. The goal is to **maximize appropriate autonomy** — autonomy where it works, manual control where it doesn't.

**Autonomy is a privilege earned through performance, not a right granted through features.**

When capabilities earn higher autonomy through stable performance, we promote them.

When capabilities lose trust through failure, we downgrade them.

This is governance. This is discipline. This is how autonomous operations scale without creating ungoverned risk.
