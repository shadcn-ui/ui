## Development

### Fork this repo

You can fork this repo by clicking the fork button in the top right corner of this page.

### Clone on your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ui.git
```

### Navigate to project directory

```bash
cd ui
```

### Create a new Branch

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run a workspace

You can use the `pnpm --filter=[WORKSPACE]` command to start the development process for a workspace.

#### Examples

1. To run the `ui.shadcn.com` website:

```bash
pnpm --filter=www dev
```

2. To run the `shadcn-ui` package:

```bash
pnpm --filter=shadcn-ui dev
```

## Running the CLI Locally

To run the CLI locally, you can follow the workflow:

1. Start by running the registry (main site) to make sure the components are up to date:

   ```bash
   pnpm www:dev
   ```

2. Run the development script for the CLI:

   ```bash
   pnpm shadcn:dev
   ```

3. In another terminal tab, test the CLI by running:

   ```bash
   pnpm shadcn
   ```

   To test the CLI in a specific app, use a command like:

   ```bash
   pnpm shadcn <init | add | ...> -c ~/Desktop/my-app
   ```

4. To run the tests for the CLI:

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter=shadcn test
   ```

This workflow ensures that you are running the most recent version of the registry and testing the CLI properly in your local environment.

## Documentation

The documentation for this project is located in the `www` workspace. You can run the documentation locally by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm --filter=www dev
```

Documentation is written using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). You can find the documentation files in the `apps/www/content/docs` directory.

## Components

We use a registry system for developing components. You can find the source code for the components under `apps/www/registry`. The components are organized by styles.

```bash
apps
└── www
    └── registry
        ├── default
        │   ├── example
        │   └── ui
        └── new-york
            ├── example
            └── ui
```

When adding or modifying components, please ensure that:

1. You make the changes for every style.
2. You update the documentation.
3. You run `pnpm build:registry` to update the registry.
