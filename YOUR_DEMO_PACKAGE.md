## 🎬 Pro Tips from Experience

### What Works:
✅ **Start with impact:** "Let me show you how to manage 4.75 billion rupiah from one system"  
✅ **Use real names:** "Sarah Wijaya is your top rep" (not "user 123")  
✅ **Show, don't tell:** Click through actual screens vs describing  
✅ **Tell stories:** "When this quality batch failed, the system prevented a recall"  
✅ **Pause for effect:** After big numbers, let them sink in  

### What Doesn't Work:
❌ Reading from slides word-for-word  
❌ Going too fast (slow down!)  
❌ Using technical jargon  
❌ Saying "um" or "so, yeah"  
❌ Apologizing for features ("this is just a demo so...")  

### Body Language (if in-person):
- **Stand** when possible (more energy)
- **Make eye contact** with all attendees
- **Use hand gestures** to emphasize points
- **Smile** when showing wins (the 95.1% quality rate)
- **Lean in** when they ask questions (shows interest)

## 🔥 Handling Tough Questions

### "This looks complicated"
**Response:** "I'm showing you everything at once, but users only see what they need. A production operator sees work orders. A sales rep sees customers. An accountant sees financials. Each role has a simplified view."

### "We already have [competitor]"
**Response:** "That's great - what's working well? [Listen] And what would you change? [Listen] Let me show you how we handle [their pain point]..."

### "We can't afford this right now"
**Response:** "I understand. What's the cost of your current process? [Calculate time spent on manual entry × hourly rate] The ROI on this is typically 6-12 months. It often pays for itself."

### "Too many features we don't need"
**Response:** "You only pay for what you use. Most clients start with 2-3 modules—production and accounting—then add sales and analytics later. It grows with you."

### "Need to discuss with team"
**Response:** "Absolutely - this is a team decision. Would it help if I did a brief demo for the production manager? Or the CFO? I'm happy to tailor the demo to each stakeholder."

## 📈 Converting Demo to Sale

### Signs You're Winning:
1. ✅ They ask about pricing/timeline
2. ✅ They introduce other decision-makers mid-demo
3. ✅ They describe their specific problems (engaged)
4. ✅ They ask "can it do [specific thing]?"
5. ✅ They take notes
6. ✅ They ask about your other clients

### Signs of Concern:
1. ⚠️ Checking phone/laptop during demo
2. ⚠️ No questions at all (not engaged)
3. ⚠️ "Send us information" with no next meeting
4. ⚠️ Only end-users in room (no decision-makers)

### How to Close:
**During demo:** Build value  
**After demo:** Ask for next meeting  
**Follow-up:** Send proposal within 48 hours  
**Week later:** Call to discuss proposal  
**Close:** Start with small commitment (pilot/trial)

**Example close:**
> "Based on what I'm hearing—you need better production visibility and automated accounting—I think modules 2, 3, and 5 would give you 80% of the value. Can I put together a pilot proposal for just those three modules? You could be running in 6 weeks."
