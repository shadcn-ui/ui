2. **Consistent sizing** - Use same resolution for all screenshots
3. **Real-looking data** - The sample data already looks realistic
4. **Show both themes** - At minimum, show light mode hero and one dark mode shot
5. **Crop toolbar** - Remove browser chrome for cleaner presentation

## Recommended Tools

- **macOS**: Cmd+Shift+4 (area) or Cmd+Shift+5 (full screen)
