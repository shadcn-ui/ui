## Launch Email to Newsletter/Audience

**Subject lines (test these):**
- I built a SaaS dashboard starter kit
- Skip 40 hours of UI work on your next SaaS
- New: ShipDash — SaaS Dashboard Starter
- Stop rebuilding login pages from scratch

---

**Email Body:**

```
Hey [NAME],

Quick update: I just launched ShipDash.

It's a SaaS dashboard starter kit with all the pages you rebuild every time:

→ Login (with social auth buttons)
→ Dashboard (stats, charts, data table)
→ Settings (profile, notifications, security)
→ Billing (pricing cards, invoices)
→ Analytics
→ Empty states

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

No backend included — that's intentional. You bring your own auth and database. ShipDash just handles the UI.

**Who it's for:**
- Indie hackers launching a SaaS
- Freelancers building client MVPs
- Devs who want a professional starting point

**Launch price: $29** (normally $49)

## Email to Friends/Network (Personal ask)

**Subject:** Quick favor? Just launched something

```
Hey [NAME],

I just launched a new product and wanted to share it with you first.

It's called ShipDash — a SaaS dashboard starter kit (React + TypeScript + Tailwind).

Basically, all the pages you rebuild for every SaaS: login, dashboard, settings, billing.

If you know anyone building a SaaS who might find it useful, I'd appreciate a share.

No pressure at all — just wanted to let you know it's out there.

Thanks!

## Follow-up Email (3 days later)

**Subject:** ShipDash update + reader question

```
Hey,

Quick update on ShipDash:

[X] people grabbed it in the first 3 days. Thanks to everyone who supported the launch!

A few people asked: "Can I see the code before buying?"

Fair question. Here's a sample of the Dashboard page structure:

Clean, typed, no magic.
