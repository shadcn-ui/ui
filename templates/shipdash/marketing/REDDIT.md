**Title:** I built a SaaS dashboard starter kit (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SideProject,

I kept rebuilding the same dashboard UI for every SaaS I started:
- Login page
- Dashboard with stats/charts
- Settings
- Billing

So I packaged it into a starter kit.

**What's included:**
- 6 production-ready pages (Login, Dashboard, Analytics, Customers, Billing, Settings)
- 15+ UI components
- Dark/light mode
- Fully responsive
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

**Tech stack:**
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Vite
- Recharts
- Radix UI

**What it's NOT:**
- Not a full SaaS boilerplate (no auth, no database)
- Not NextJS specific (vanilla React)
- No backend opinions

It's just the frontend UI. You bring your own backend.

**Pricing:** $29 (launch price, normally $49)

Happy to answer questions!

## r/reactjs Post

**Title:** Built a SaaS dashboard starter with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind

**Body:**
```
Sharing a project I built: a SaaS dashboard UI starter kit.

**Why I built it:**
Every SaaS needs login, dashboard, settings, and billing pages. I got tired of rebuilding them.

**Tech decisions:**
- **React 19** - Latest features, no legacy baggage
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety throughout
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Fast styling, easy customization
- **Vite** - Because waiting for builds is painful
- **Radix UI** - Accessible primitives, unstyled
- **Recharts** - Clean charts that just work

**What's included:**
- 6 pages (Login, Dashboard, Analytics, Customers, Billing, Settings)
- 15+ reusable UI components
- Dark mode (follows system)
- Responsive layout with mobile sidebar

**What's NOT included:**
- No backend/API (frontend only)
- No auth logic (just the UI)
- No state management opinions

The goal was a professional starting point that doesn't lock you into any backend choices.

## r/indiehackers Post

**Title:** I packaged my SaaS dashboard UI into a $29 starter kit

**Body:**
```
After building 3 SaaS side projects, I realized I was rebuilding the same UI every time:

- Login page
- Dashboard with charts
- Settings page
- Billing page

So I packaged it into a starter kit.

**What you get:**
- 6 production-ready pages
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Dark mode, responsive
- Clean code you can actually understand

**What you DON'T get:**
- No backend (you bring your own)
- No auth service
- No database

It's just the frontend. ~40 hours of UI work, done.

**Pricing:** $29 launch / $49 regular

I'm curious: would you pay for something like this, or do you prefer building from scratch?

## Comment Replies (Templates)

### "Why not just use a free template?"
```
Fair point! Free templates exist, but they're usually:
- Blog templates (not SaaS dashboards)
- Incomplete (missing settings, billing, empty states)
- Poorly maintained

ShipDash is specifically designed for SaaS with all the pages you actually need. But if a free option works for you, go for it!
```

### "Is the code quality good?"
```
It's built with:
- TypeScript (fully typed)
- Consistent component patterns
- Clean file structure
- No prop drilling
- Radix UI for accessibility

Happy to share code snippets if you want to evaluate before buying.
```

### "Why not NextJS?"
```
Vanilla React works everywhere: NextJS, Remix, Vite SPA, Electron, etc.

If I made it NextJS-specific, it wouldn't work for people using other frameworks.

You can easily drop these components into a NextJS app — they're just React components.
