I built a SaaS dashboard starter kit.

Stop rebuilding the same UI pages for every project:
- Login with social auth
- Dashboard with charts & tables
- Settings (profile, notifications, security)
- Billing with pricing cards
- Empty states

React + TypeScript + Tailwind

## Launch Thread

### Tweet 1
```
I built a SaaS dashboard starter kit.

Every SaaS needs the same pages: login, dashboard, settings, billing.

I got tired of rebuilding them. So I packaged it.

Here's what's inside 🧵
```

### Tweet 2
```
6 production-ready pages:

✓ Login (with Google/GitHub buttons)
✓ Dashboard (stats, charts, data table)
✓ Analytics (page views, conversions)
✓ Customers (with empty state)
✓ Billing (pricing cards, invoices)
✓ Settings (profile, notifications, security)
```

### Tweet 3
```
Modern tech stack:

- React 19
- TypeScript (fully typed)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Vite (fast builds)
- Recharts (beautiful charts)
- Radix UI (accessible)

No bloat. No opinions about your backend.
```

### Tweet 4
```
Dark mode? Built in.
Responsive? Of course.
Mobile sidebar? Yes.

The UI details you'd normally spend days on — done.
```

### Tweet 5
```
Who it's for:

→ Indie hackers shipping their first SaaS
→ Freelancers building client MVPs
→ Devs who want a professional foundation

Who it's NOT for:

→ People wanting a full backend solution
→ Complete turnkey SaaS boilerplate seekers
```

### Tweet 6 (CTA)
```
Launch price: $29 (normally $49)

One-time purchase. Commercial use included.

Skip the boring parts. Ship faster.

### Version A (Problem-focused)
```
Every time I start a new SaaS, I rebuild the same UI:

- Login page
- Dashboard with charts
- Settings page
- Billing page

So I packaged it into a starter kit.

Because I already built it once and packaged it.

## Follow-up Tweets (Post-Launch)

### Day 2
```
Update: [X] people grabbed ShipDash in the first 24 hours.

Thank you for the support! 🙏

If you bought it, I'd love to see what you build.

Still $29 for a few more days → [LINK]
```

### Feature highlight
```
One thing I love about ShipDash:

The empty states.

Most starters forget about "no data yet" screens.

ShipDash includes them. Because your users will see them first.

### "How is this different from X?"
```
Good question! ShipDash is just the frontend — no backend opinions.

It's for devs who have their own auth/database and just want professional UI pages ready to customize.

Think of it as a head start, not a full boilerplate.
```

### "Can I use this with [framework]?"
```
ShipDash is vanilla React, so it works with any backend.

NextJS, Remix, or even a plain Vite SPA — it's just components and pages.
```

### "Is there a demo?"
```
Screenshots are in the product page: [LINK]

It's also a one-time $29 purchase, so low risk to try it out.
