## Launch Post

```
I built a SaaS dashboard starter kit.

Why?

Every SaaS I've built needed the same UI:
→ Login page
→ Dashboard with charts
→ Settings page
→ Billing page

I was tired of rebuilding these from scratch.

So I packaged it into ShipDash:
• 6 production-ready pages
• React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
• Dark mode, fully responsive
• Clean, maintainable code

It's just the frontend — you bring your own backend.

Perfect for:
• Indie hackers launching their first SaaS
• Freelancers building client MVPs
• Teams wanting a professional starting point

Launch price: $29 (one-time, commercial use included)

Hot take: Most "SaaS starter kits" are too complex.

You don't need:
❌ Opinionated auth
❌ Pre-configured database
❌ 47 integrations you'll never use

You need:
✅ Clean login page
✅ Dashboard with real charts
✅ Settings that actually work
✅ Billing page with pricing cards

That's why I built ShipDash — a frontend-only SaaS dashboard starter.

React + TypeScript + Tailwind. Nothing else.

You bring your own backend. Keep your architecture decisions.
