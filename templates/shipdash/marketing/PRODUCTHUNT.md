You've built these before. You'll build them again.

## Maker Comment (First Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm the maker of ShipDash.

After building several SaaS side projects, I noticed I was rebuilding the same dashboard UI every time. Login page, settings, billing, charts — it's always the same.

So I packaged it.

ShipDash is intentionally simple:
- Just frontend (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- No backend opinions
- No complex setup

Download, npm install, and you have a professional dashboard ready to customize.

Happy to answer any questions!

## FAQ for Product Hunt

**Q: How is this different from Tailwind UI?**
```
Tailwind UI sells individual components. ShipDash is complete pages wired together into a working dashboard.
```

**Q: Does this include authentication?**
```
No. ShipDash is frontend-only. You connect your own auth (Clerk, Auth0, Supabase, custom, etc.)
```

**Q: Can I use this for client projects?**
```
Yes! Commercial use is included in the license.
```

**Q: Is there a demo I can try?**
```
Screenshots show all pages. Since it's $29 one-time with no refunds, I recommend reviewing the screenshots and feature list before purchasing.
```

**Q: Why React and not NextJS?**
```
Vanilla React works everywhere. You can use this with NextJS, Remix, Vite, or any other setup.
