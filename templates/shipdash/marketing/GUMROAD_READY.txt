# Launch Your SaaS Dashboard in Minutes, Not Weeks

A complete, production-ready dashboard UI built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Just add your backend.

---

## The Problem

Every SaaS needs the same pages:
- Login
- Dashboard
- Settings
- Billing

You've built these before. You'll build them again. Each time takes 2-4 weeks of repetitive work.

## The Solution

ShipDash gives you a complete dashboard starter with all the essential pages, professionally designed and ready to customize.

Download. Install. Ship.
