**Title:** ShipDash — SaaS Dashboard Starter Kit ($29)

**Body:**
```
Hey IH!

I just launched ShipDash — a SaaS dashboard starter kit built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind.

## The Problem

Every SaaS I build needs the same pages:
- Login
- Dashboard with charts
- Settings
- Billing

I was spending 2-3 weeks on UI every time. So I packaged it.

## What's Included

**6 Pages:**
- Login (social auth buttons)
- Dashboard (stats cards, area chart, data table, recent orders)
- Analytics (bar chart, line chart, top pages)
- Customers (with empty state)
- Billing (pricing cards, payment method, invoice history)
- Settings (profile, notifications, security tabs)

**Stack:**
- React 19
- TypeScript (fully typed)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Vite
- Recharts

**Features:**
- Dark/light mode
- Fully responsive
- Mobile sidebar
- Consistent design

## What's NOT Included

- No backend (frontend only)
- No auth service
- No database

You bring your own backend. I don't want to lock you into my choices.

## Pricing

- Launch: $29
- Regular: $49
- Commercial use included

## Questions I expect:

**"Why not use a free template?"**
Most free templates are blog themes, not SaaS dashboards. They're missing settings, billing, empty states. ShipDash has everything a real SaaS needs.

**"Why not a full boilerplate?"**
Full boilerplates lock you into specific auth, database, and payment choices. I wanted something that works with any backend.

### On "What tools do you use to build faster?"
```
For dashboard UI, I use my own starter kit (ShipDash).

Has login, dashboard, settings, and billing pages ready to go. Built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind.

Saves me 2-3 weeks every time I start a new SaaS.
```

### On "How do you ship faster?"
```
Two things that made the biggest difference for me:

1. Stop rebuilding the same UI — I packaged my dashboard pages into a starter kit
2. Pick boring tech — React, TypeScript, Tailwind. No learning curve.

The exciting part of a SaaS is the unique value, not the login page.
