<!--

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Remix!

Our bandwidth on maintaining these stacks is limited. As a team, we're currently
focusing our efforts on Remix itself. The good news is you can fork and adjust
this stack however you'd like and start using it today as a custom stack. Learn
more from [the Remix Stacks docs](https://remix.run/stacks).

You're still welcome to make a PR. We can't promise a timely response, but
hopefully when we have the bandwidth to work on these stacks again we can take
a look. Thanks!
