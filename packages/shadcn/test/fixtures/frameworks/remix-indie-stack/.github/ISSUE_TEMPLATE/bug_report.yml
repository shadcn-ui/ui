        Thank you for helping to improve Remix!

        Our bandwidth on maintaining these stacks is limited. As a team, we're
        currently focusing our efforts on Remix itself. The good news is you can
        fork and adjust this stack however you'd like and start using it today
        as a custom stack. Learn more from
        [the Remix Stacks docs](https://remix.run/stacks).

        If you'd still like to report a bug, please fill out this form. We can't
        promise a timely response, but hopefully when we have the bandwidth to
        work on these stacks again we can take a look. Thanks!
